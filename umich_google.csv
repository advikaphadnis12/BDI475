Between the several times I visited, countless problems occurred. The gym, lobby, and study rooms were completely trashed from flooding that occurred because the staff kept the temperature too low. The gym was out of service both times I visited which was 2 months apart. On top of this, the power in most of the rooms barely worked. The outlets didn't function which prevented any charger or lights to work with the exception of the one overhead light. Clearly, the building was built horribly. From my understanding, utility bills were several hundred dollars per person per month which is the most outrageous expense I've ever heard. Next, the hot tub/pool was ""out of service"" pretty much the entire year. There was no explanation for why it was unusable and remained untouched and unfixed until pretty much the last week of classes. The structural elements of this place were ridiculous. For being a newly built apartment building, this place looked like a trashed several decade old build. Walls were cracking and separating from the floor. Also, from the burst pipes I previously mentioned, several tenants' rooms were completely destroyed. From the individuals I talked to, it sounded like they were promised to have their rooms fixed within a couple months. As it turns out, the horrible management failed to have any desire to follow through. Ultimately, these individuals never got to return to their apartments. These ruined parts of the building were essentially a construction site the entire year. Loud fans tried to air out the smell of mildew and paint. Cardboard and dust covered the floors and walls. I'm so glad I wasn't one of the tenants here. I was staying with friends for what added up to be maybe 3 weeks. Those 3 weeks enlightened me to just had bad a residence and a management team can be. The workers were unresponsive and rude. They pretended everything was fine with the apartment while things were clearly in disrepair. From what I heard and saw, maintenance orders went unanswered and unresolved for months. It's insane how much they charge for this place. I would never live here.",,,,,"Hey Jacob, we apologize when you have visited the property it has been a less than pleasurable visit.

However, our perception quickly shifted upon moving in. Constant maintenance issues that take weeks to be resolved, promised amenities that either don't exist or are unavailable, and messy common areas have led to a less than ideal living experience. We have had ongoing maintenance issues in our apartment that have been left unattended for months. Our attempts to reach the leasing office lead to vague answers that don't resolve issues. For the high price that this building charges, it has not seemed worth it after one semester. I suggest looking elsewhere for housing, as you will not get your money's worth here.",,,,,"Hi Joshua,

This includes that they are literally charging 12 months rent for 11 months because they have ""housing contracts"" and not monthly rent. I've never heard of anything like this in my life. They blatantly misled me into believing my monthly rent would be much lower than it is.

1. You are rich af and willing to donate one EXTRA month rent to your future apt, because you will actually pay 12 months of rent for 11 months of living.
2. You love the smell of garbage and enjoy living with trash bags.
3. You desperately want to hear a symphony performed by your washing machine, dryer, AC, and dishwasher.
4. You are interested in flooding scene in Universal Studio Tour but cannot go to LA due to schedule. (You definitely want to try standard, because it gives you a series of authentic experiences: getting notified when your home destroyed by the pipe bursting; rushing back home to pack your luggage; living in a hotel; relocating to another hotel that 4 miles away from central campus; HAVING WAITED MORE THAN TWO WEEKS for them to repair your apt and without getting home until now.
