I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to discuss the deductions made from my security deposit for my tenancy at 1107 S Fourth, Unit 3 during the last academic year.

Upon reviewing the itemized list of deductions, I noted the following charges:

Paint and repair: $400
Cleaning: $880
Item Removal: $350
Carpet cleaning: $205

The total deductions amount (1835 dollars) is a substantial portion of my security deposit. My roommate and I have not caused any damage to the property nor have we left a mess for you to clean. As a tenant, I am entitled to transparency regarding these charges. I request the provision of receipts for each service that was allegedly carried out. This is not only to verify the costs but also to ensure that these services were conducted by legitimate and operational businesses.

Having consulted with my school's legal services, I've been informed that I have the right to request and review these receipts. To expedite the resolution of this matter, I propose two options:

1, Kindly provide me with the respective receipts for the aforementioned services. (I'll send it to my attorney to validate the legitimacy of the company and its service)
2, Alternatively, I am willing to accept a refund of 80% of my original security deposit, and we can consider the matter resolved.

Should I not receive the requested receipts or the proposed refund within a reasonable timeframe, I want to inform you that I am prepared to escalate the matter. While I genuinely hope to resolve this amicably, I will not hesitate to seek legal recourse through my school's attorney to ensure my rights as a tenant are upheld.

I trust that we can come to a satisfactory resolution promptly. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Warm regards,
Peter Chen",,,,,"Peter, thank you for your detailed and thoughtful review. 
Your thorough approach is appreciated. 
We are really sorry that you had unexpected charges on your security deposit.

At the same time, we have a high standard for cleanliness and we do provide all of our tenants with cleaning guidelines before turning in the keys that were not followed in this case. Therefore, the charges were necessary. 

Should you have any other questions, we would be happy to discuss this with you further, Peter.

I recommend MHM Properties; I personally had good experience with them.

UPDATE: We eventually got back $185 painting and $135 for cleaning, but that is only because we have fought with them over a month. They charged us for food debris left in kitchen cabinets, but we have cleaned every single cabinet even those ones above the microwave/fridge that we had never used during the whole lease term. In their videos, there is no proof of food stains/debris, etc. We have to show them our video where I literally opened every cabinet and show each one is thoroughly cleaned (INSANE, RIGHT?). They also charged us for floor cleaning fees in the bedrooms, but the bedrooms are ALL carpets, and they have already charged $175 for carpet cleaning. They claimed that carpet cleaning is only for steaming carpet, and floor cleaning means vacuuming. I dont why they can double charged you for the same service. We did vacuum the carpets (even though we knew we are charged with carpet cleaning fees), and there are even vacuum traces left on the carpet in the photos shown <- This is the only reason we got money back on this. I guess they are somewhat reasonable, but it is still very painful to put so much effort in cleaning, take photos and videos of literally everything (including base board), argue with them (they respond once a week...), and only get back a fraction of your well-deserved money.

We also got charged for $175 carpeting, $220 cleaning and $185 painting out of security deposit when we moved out. I have attached some photos of the move-out condition; we also took some videos including but not limited to the interior of fridge, microwave, oven, cabinet, closet, windows, mirrors, sinks, etc. It is actually even cleaner than move-in condition since we moved in early and this was the new construction.
We have no issue with carpet cleaning fees as we were aware of it prior to signing the lease. It’s just interesting to point out that the estimate costs of carpet cleaning on the lease varies from the size of rooms, but most of my friends got charged $175 regardless of the unit.
There is no detail of what is cleaned, which wall needs to be re-painted on the invoice. I heard that some people got charged with carpet cleaning fees but they didn’t even have carpet inside their units, so I wildly guess they just sent the same invoice to a certain group of people regardless of each tenant’s unit condition. I requested a move-out video taken from their inspectors, so far no replies.

We also experienced many other issues people mentioned in their reviews: we signed an unit which was planned to finish remodeling before the early move-in date (and was confirmed by the leasing agent), but it didn’t due to COVID. We eventually got rearranged to this nicer apartment. When we moved in, there was no furniture and not cleaned at all. A bunch of glue-like stuff and paint stains were on the floor/island/bathtub and splinters/dusts from construction were everywhere. Our doors are not properly installed and cannot be fixed by the maintenance team, so we cannot close the door without making noise. We got our bar stools one and half month after move-in date and we never get the TV stand as promised on the lease and in the email conversations.

We have wall painting damage under the electricity box only because the unit above us decided to flood their restroom with water, and somehow we (and one of the maintenance staff, I thank him for dealing with this issue very promptly) are affected by that and had to lose over a half night of sleep on Sunday midnight, due to some flaws of the building structure. We lost electricity the whole night including the fridge and other major appliances. Water keeps dripping down into the electric box; it was scary (see attached photo).",https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMeBoknIYx8jx_C6DDpXzlng8SV3YANFPrYmYN,"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMeBoknIYx8jx_C6DDpXzlng8SV3YANFPrYmYN, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPJ9M1nqD5HtfvWoHD4AKjlbpbxSeqMrqktwuWr, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMVM5xpyED2FIroOm5vqsG-69wTUlMJa-Oopy_n, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOx3plzmRkSurvSudvDFmJO94u9mBwUx3nHoJ5Z, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNKzCXGqy2nu8NtL58KbW41mrY2jGiNaIuQaiyO, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOPY7vMGUSB0CL7AAoOJGR5Zx4j6gWamusab_yv, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNXWIchMwPlwCk9wAMemgzo5XCYcAxjpRMbvlaD",,"AF1QipMMeBoknIYx8jx_C6DDpXzlng8SV3YANFPrYmYN, AF1QipPJ9M1nqD5HtfvWoHD4AKjlbpbxSeqMrqktwuWr, AF1QipMVM5xpyED2FIroOm5vqsG-69wTUlMJa-Oopy_n, AF1QipOx3plzmRkSurvSudvDFmJO94u9mBwUx3nHoJ5Z, AF1QipNKzCXGqy2nu8NtL58KbW41mrY2jGiNaIuQaiyO, AF1QipOPY7vMGUSB0CL7AAoOJGR5Zx4j6gWamusab_yv, AF1QipNXWIchMwPlwCk9wAMemgzo5XCYcAxjpRMbvlaD","Linz, thank you for taking the time to leave us feedback. We are so sorry that these charges were unexpected. We can certainly understand how these issues must have been frustrating.

We are known for our quick maintenance service. I'm glad that we had someone on-site quickly for the flooding issue. I am very sorry that you experienced challenges with your unit. Our maintenance team does the very best they can to resolve issues in a timely manner.

As for the security deposit, we have a high standard for the cleanliness of our apartment units. The units must be cleaned according to the move-out procedures on our website. ( https://ugroupcu.com/move-in-move-out/ ) These procedures are the same steps that we go through to make sure the apartment is clean enough for a new renter or it must be cleaned.

In regards to the carpet cleaning fee in apartments that do not have carpet, on rare occasions, our system incorrectly charges tenants. In those cases, the tenants are refunded the carpet cleaning fee.

We take making our units ready for the next tenant very seriously.
Once again, we are sorry that the charges were unexpected.
Our team aims to serve our tenants with a high standard of excellence.

We would love to speak with you about this to see how we might improve.
Please email us at Account.Inquiries@UGroupCU.com.
We look forward to hearing from you.

THEY WILL ROB YOUR CHILDREN BLIND!!!  WATER LEAKING FROM THE ROOF. NO HOT WATER- NO HEAT.
This was a first time renting experience for our children.  They were taken advantage of.  As parents were unable to help. We were not on the lease.
Did walk thru after move out.There were no issues.  My daughter received an email today, that they were going to keep half of the security deposit, 600+ dollars for normal wear and tear, and the cost to repaint for the next set of tenants. The staff are U of I students.  And they are taught to rob their fellow class mates.  To be rude, and hung up on .   They should be ashamed of themselves.  People treated people this way.  This is not how professional people work.  They are learning skills that will get them nowhere. Maintenance went into their   apt over the break when no one is there- changed the heat settings/fan settings- without tenants' knowledge. Once the bill comes it's triple the amount of money.  And no one is even there. They were home on break.  Again, no response from leasing group.  Bill had to be paid.
Plenty of other rental buildings to go rent from.  Spare your child the trauma.  THIS GROUP WILL ROB YOU OF AS MUCH MONEY AS THEY CAN. !!!  They are unreachable.  Made several trips from Chicago to see someone face to face.  Impossible!.  They intimidated our children.  INFURIATING!! And they wouldn't dare speak to us as parents, because they know we won't be intimidated.  Their favorite saying.. ""you are not on the lease"". I can only imagine how many times they have been sued. !! Most of us walk away.. Lesson learned.. Our kids - who pay this rent with their own money, are traumatized.  I live in a big city. And have never come across such low life people, preying on young college kids.
You can never speak to management, just students.  Emails never answered.  Just pay them their money, or they will continue to add on charges. Maybe if enough people write reviews, which I see there are quite a lot .  People will keep away. I only wished that we had read them, prior to our kids signing a lease. This building is under code.  So many issues.. Check the city records... People get found out eventually.

The person that was living there had several allies on help with rent being paid,,,,,"Meleka, thank you for leaving us feedback here. 
We're sure these charges were stressful and unexpected. 

However, the charges were due to three major breaches of our policies: 
1) You continued to live in the apartment past the lease end date
2) Belongings were left in the apartment seven months after the lease end date.
3) Your vehicle was left on the premises seven months after the lease end date. 

Due to these issues:
1) No one else could move into the apartment and we had to charge for rent for those seven months
2) The vehicle had to be towed 

Furthermore, we have it on record that you did sign the lease, and our policies were made known to you. 
Again, we're sure that these events were stressful and challenging but because there were no payments made and the belongings were not moved out to remedy these breaches of policy, we had no other choice. 
As such, the total balance of $5,704.25 was sent to collections.

If you have any questions please email us at leasing@ugroupcu.com. 

We wish you all the best, Meleka.

Do not lease with them!

Apartment had black mold on windows, and maintenance told me there was nothing to be done.

The previous tenant left furniture and personal belongings behind and it was made my responsibility to clean. In addition, the sinks were filthy upon move in and so badly clogged with hair that not more than a couple drops of water could drain.

In addition, the carpet smelled musty and had clumps of hair in some spots. As someone who has worked cleaning carpets professionally in the past, this was most definitely not cleaned correctly. It was very clear that their “professional” cleaning services weren’t thorough in any regard.

Drywall was damaged and had signs of leaking when I moved in and after noting it, it was promised to be repaired. Not once was it addressed in the entire 12 months of the lease.

Multiple water leaks that destroyed personal belongings and they left open holes in ceiling for the remaining duration of the lease.

And I wouldn’t recommend parking your car near their structures. A piece of the ceiling came off and fell on my car and they acknowledged that it was a problem that they were aware of, but didn’t fix.

In the winter they took an absurd amount of time to ever clear the snow, even when all other apartments were cleared, University Group simply kept saying they had so many properties and that they were going to get to us eventually.

And of course to top it all off, they are withholding almost $500 of the security deposit for damages that do not exist, and in fact they caused themselves. While trying to contact them they are extremely hard to get any response from and very rude over the phone.

If you want a nice place to live, without mold and constant maintenance nightmares, look elsewhere!!!!

And if you’ve already made the mistake of leasing with them and lost a big chunk of your security deposit, I suggest contacting the university student legal services!

UPDATE: If you get your security deposit check, look at the invoices. They are using these companies to make fake invoices, it is clear as day!

EDIT: Notice in their reply they avoided addressing all of the other things besides their cleaning fees. They are a dishonest company, it’s very clear. They hit me with every charge and walked back on some once I pressed them.",,,,,"Adrian, thank you for taking time to give us feedback. 
We are so sorry that you experienced unexpected charges. 
We can understand your frustration and the feedback you've provided is helpful. However, charges were necessary in this case. Please see below. 

We have a high standard for the cleanliness of our apartment units. The units must be fully cleaned according to the move-out procedures on our website: https://ugroupcu.com/move-in-move-out/
These procedures are the same steps that we go through to make sure the apartment is clean enough for a new renter or the unit must be professionally cleaned. In this case, cleaning was still necessary to make the unit move-in ready for the next tenant. You can see the move-out condition video here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uzkUHECi9pOCcs6m37ObSxPNy9U09D2l/view?usp=sharing

They refuse to put cameras and their communications about this have been horrible. It’s basically “not our problem, call the police” type response.

I received a package vie fedex this Monday and asked if they could pick it up for me since it’s valuable and I will not be in town to do so myself. I even offered to send an email releasing them of all and any liability. They refused to do so. Surely enough, by the time I came back to my apartment on Wednesday, someone already tore open the package, stole the content and left the opened bag in the lobby.

Thanks UGroup. Don’t even respond to this email with the fake “we take reviews seriously” because your actions have proven otherwise.",,,,,"Hello Haris, it's a real bummer that your package got taken. That is the worst. We're really sorry this happened. 

As a policy, we don't put packages into apartments due to security and liability reasons. 
We also do not have enough staff members to manage package delivery effectively. The building that you are living in is a secure building so someone must have stolen it from inside of the secure building. 

The fact is that cameras are often not feasible which is why not all buildings have them. Furthermore, in order for the cameras to be effective, you have to be able to see the face of the person (most people stealing packages wear masks). 

Nonetheless, package theft is an issue for every apartment building (we've talked with several others) and it is very hard to prevent and prosecute. 
This is why Amazon, FedEx, etc, have lockers and pick-up points.
 Again, it's extremely unfortunate that this happened. 
We really wish there was more we could do to help you, Haris.

That being said, we have a high standard for the cleanliness of our apartment units. The units must be cleaned according to the move-out procedures on our website: https://ugroupcu.com/move-in-move-out/
These procedures are the same steps that we go through to make sure the apartment is clean enough for a new renter or it must be professionally cleaned before the next tenant moves in.
We would be happy to speak with you about this. You can see from the video at the link below that cleaning was still necessary in this case: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sjhCddLZlf1UrLsAvwO9iOQcHsecNZuq/view?usp=sharing

Some of the companies that they contracted to “Clean” your apartment after move out as well as “Paint” your apartment  have little to no contact information to follow up on the exaggerated amount they charged as those fees. The company they used to Clean doesn’t show up on Illinois state Secretary as a registered business at all which is super sus.

I was charged from my security deposit $600 in “cleaning charges” when I cleaned for hours before I moved out and $300 “painting charges” for normal wear and tear. Looking at the reviews, it seems like they did this to every tenant they had. Awful company to rent with who doesn’t care about anything except stealing from students and taking advantage of renters because they don’t think they’ll fight back.

Edit: Very VERY strange for a leasing company to post publicly a woman’s former address and a video of her former apartment online for anyone to see. Clearly this company doesn’t care about their tenants privacy or safety either. Also, I don’t think the video shows $600 worth of cleaning and $300 worth of damage, but I digress.",,,,,"Madeline, thank you for taking the time to give us feedback.
We are so sorry that you experienced unexpected charges.
We can certainly understand your frustration.

We have a high standard for the cleanliness of our apartment units. The units must be fully cleaned according to the move-out procedures on our website: https://ugroupcu.com/move-in-move-out/
These procedures are the same steps that we go through to make sure the apartment is clean enough for a new renter or the unit must be professionally cleaned.
As you'll see in the move-out video below, work was necessary to make the unit move-in ready for the next tenant.

That's my sad experience with them, we were charged ~1150 for cleaning, while the monthly rent is ~450 per person. That was several years ago, and I was kind enough to think it was my own problem at that time, until I heard stories from others in these years.
I've been in Champaign for more than 5 years now, and have experienced multiple companies, cpm, jsm, green st, etc, only University Group charge this amount of cleaning (Not to mention that when I moved in, there are rotten food in the fridge that smells like ****, despite the expensive ""cleaning"" they did).

We are sorry that you experienced unexpected charges.
We can certainly understand your frustration.

We have a high standard for the cleanliness of our apartment units. The units must be fully cleaned according to the move-out procedures on our website: https://ugroupcu.com/move-in-move-out/
These procedures are the same steps that we go through to make sure the apartment is clean enough for a new renter or the unit must be professionally cleaned. In this case, cleaning was still necessary to make the unit move-in ready for the next tenant.
Here is the video showing the condition of the apartment after move-out: https://drive.google.com/file/d/11_3xYMPSJsJlDzhm74nz23Y3ot00lUvE/view?usp=sharing

Ugroup charged me $600+ by listing only ""cleaning"" and ""painting"" on their invoices billed by vendors - note, these are invoices, not receipts. They did not list the specific damages I incurred to warrant such a high cost. I emailed three weeks ago and got no reply (same thing happened to many).

In response to your comments below:
1 - Your lease lists the carpet cleaning charges as ""estimates"", not ""minimum"", and so far it seems you often, if not always, charge people an amount much higher than these estimates without any justification

2 - We do not know whether you actually paid the said amount on invoice, if ever

3 - Even if you do, what the tenants are responsible for are the damages THEY caused, not how much YOU paid for.

4 - You take detailed videos of the units in each turnover, why not release them to tenants?

5 - Why do you insist on charging carpet cleaning fees to former tenants even though the vendor actually skipped that unit by mistake? And why do you charge $1000 in painting fees when the old tenants dropped by and found no new painting at all?

Lastly, just some food for thought as inspiration for business practice:

We’re very sorry that you had unexpected charges. However, these charges were necessary because we have high standards for cleanliness and we had to prepare the unit for the next tenant.

Edit: Updated to 3 stars. Maintenance is great, but beware of charges on your deposit. I was charged a carpet cleaning fee even though my apartment had all wooden floor. I was also charged for wall painting even though I've already had maintenance come in to paint the walls and ceilings 2 times. The building was one of the oldest ones on campus.
TLDR; maintenance is great, but beware of charges on your deposit, be prepared to take lots of photos.

The issue was completely resolved and the furnace was returned to a fully functional status on December 6, 2021.
As for the furniture, our furniture supplier and their supply chain has been backed up due to COVID-19. We will deliver the furniture as soon as our supplier is able to break through the bottleneck.

Update: We went to the office and they said there is no one else to talk about this except this one guy in charge of that  email address. We can not call him either. We can either sue them or just wait. Can you believe that? Please guys do not trust them when considering leasing!!

This is most terrible experience during my years of stay in CU area! Definitely a ripoff! Our deposit is 1480 dollars and they took 1145 from it. When moving out, we cleaned the apartment like shining and recorded video as proof. However, they charged 1145 in total for cleaning. This is nonsense. Where is that wall painting 370 dollars come from since there is no dirt on the wall at all? How come you charge a unit way much cleaner than its move in condition for 600 dollars? How come you charge carpet cleaning for 175 dollars when we did carpet cleaning ourselves?  We have video proof and they do not respond to our email to the account inquires service address at all. Now We wonder if we shall seek for legal service help that the university offers.",,,,,"Qian, thank you for taking the time to give the feedback that you provided here. We are so sorry that you experienced unexpected charges. We can certainly understand your frustration.

We have a high standard for the cleanliness of our apartment units. The units must be cleaned according to the move-out procedures on our website: https://ugroupcu.com/move-in-move-out/
These procedures are the same steps that we go through to make sure the apartment is clean enough for a new renter or it must be cleaned. In this case, a significant amount of cleaning was still necessary for the unit to be move-in ready for the next tenant. Furthermore, carpet cleaning is stated on the lease as a standard charge for this apartment unit as it needs consistent cleaning to be move-in ready.

We would be happy to speak with you about this to see how we might improve.

Situation:
University Group has left me with no functional washer since the beginning of my lease. When I contacted them to tell them this is not right neither fair, and that I consider it part of the rent I pay, they said:
a) The washer is included, but the rent is for the apartment and not the washer itself.
b) I should be able to Google and find washers near campus myself while I am waiting for the issue to be fixed. They did not consider it as their responsibility.
Also, they were interrupting me and being rude towards me. When I told them this is not okay they hung up the phone on me. When I called them back to report the incident, they also hang up on me. When I sent them an e-mail about this, they never replied back.

First, they are very soft on people who break the rules. I had a party person living in the unit right above me and she was having party every weekend. The noise was crazy loud in the midnight. Some policeman came and even that police officer know that party person and the officer told me that person in notorious in the area. They even had people yelling in the balcony and smoking weeds. I reported to the University Group office and they keep saying they've let that person know but they can't really do anything. I was expecting they to start an eviction process to that person but nothing really happened. She only got fined by the police once.

Second, they didn't tell me that other tenant has taken our unit in the new semester year and they never asked us if we wanted to extend our contract. I asked them why they did that and they just told me I was having a short term lease but in fact my lease was 10-month. And I had been living in midtown plaza for 3 years.

Last but not least, they will charge you a lot of money when you leave their property no matter how hard you clean the unit. My deposit was 600 and it was all taken. They told me to charge me extra 600 for painting and cleaning.

Just do everything you could to avoid the University Group and their properties.",,,,,"Yi, thank you for taking the time to provide feedback.
We are so sorry that you experienced these inconveniences with us.
We can certainly understand your frustration here.

We are aware of the loud tenant that lived near you at Midtown Plaza. We were pleased that the police were able to get involved and intervene with at least a ticket. We would have proceeded with the eviction process to evict the tenant, however, the current COVID-19 eviction moratorium issued by the state of Illinois did not allow us to evict that person despite their behavior. We certainly wish there was more that we could have done to stop the tenant from disturbing the peace for you and other tenants that followed the noise rules. We share your frustration that it was not possible to evict the tenant.

As for the security deposit, we have a high standard for the cleanliness of our apartment units. The units must be fully cleaned according to the move-out procedures on our website: https://ugroupcu.com/move-in-move-out/
These procedures are the same steps that we go through to make sure the apartment is clean enough for a new renter or the unit must be professionally cleaned. In this case, cleaning was still necessary to make the unit move-in ready for the next tenant.

If something is wrong with your house, they will use excuses. Not recommended.

Update/Answer to Univ. Group (Aug 25, 2021):

-- Regarding the furniture: You should have a Plan B, which you clearly do not. This is your problem, not your supplier's.
- The 1/2 month rent credit does not correspond to the damage you cause when all furniture (including the bed) are missing.
- You provided a washer that was not properly tested in advance, so when I tried to use it, it just did not work. You are aware of this issue, and cannot provide an estimated day on when it will be fixed.  The only thing you told me is that you will try your best and that the City of Champaign gives you up to 30 days to respond to my request.

Thanks for leaving me without a way to wash my clothes, and without furniture! At least you did a 1/2 month rent discount --while others would argue your company did not deserve to even get the other half.

So yes, there are things that you can do: start maybe by seeing your maintenance list and prioritizing the requests accordingly, hire more people, do a better job.",,,,,"Antonis, we are so sorry about the inconveniences you have experienced with the furniture delays. Although we ordered furniture one year ago, our supplier has experienced many unforeseen delays caused by COVID-19. We were happy to see that you received the 1/2 month rent credit that we sent on August 18 to say that we are so sorry for the inconveniences you've experienced. We will keep you informed as we have updates in regards to this.
Is there anything else we can do for you?

I lived at 706 S 1st for 2 years and overall the stay was fine. Honestly this building is pretty old as compared to other properties and that was evident with the appliances etc provided to us and one could see that after looking at the overall building condition. We requested and got the couch as well as the mattresses changed since they were in a bad condition and Ugroup did that without charging us any extra amount.

However the biggest problem for us was the laundry.  While most buildings have card operated laundry , our building had just 1 old coin slot washer and dryer and every month the coin circuit would get blocked and we had to raise a complain. On asking Ugroup for a new card operated machine, they mentioned it was upto coinmach(the machine providers) to replace it and when I spoke to coinmach they said it was upto Ugroup to raise a request, so basically a dead end. For more than 3 months in the winter of 2020, our building laundry was out of service and we were forced to do laundry in another building which was a big pain specially in peak winter months where we had to carry our clothes while it was freezing outside. We did complain but Ugroup simply mentioned that we need to get in touch with coinmach since they are the ones who own the machines. After making literally 20+ calls to coinmach over a span of 3 months, our machine was repaired and all this was without the help of Ugroup. However towards the end of our lease , we again faced problems and were without our dryer for a month and Ugroup simply said they couldn't do anything. When you have just 1 washer and 1 dryer in a building of 20+ residents, this inconvenience is unbearable. Ugroup should have a better alternative in such situations because we certainly are paying them the rent for residing in their building and not coinmach.

As far as the security deposit is concerned, Andy from the accounts team was super helpful. They had charged us for apartment painting but after showing the before move in and before move out photos, we got the full amount refunded to us. They did charge us for carpet cleaning and other cleaning charges which were a bit higher due to covid as per Ugroup, however it was still not that bad when I see other tenant reviews. They do send you a PDF that has all the breakdown of the cleaning charges and they also send you videos of areas/things that needed extreme cleaning, so that was certainly helpful. The carpet cleaning was $50 extra than what was estimated in the lease (covid was given as the reason) but our apartment cleaning charges were a bit more that what I expected. Overall I'm just happy atleast Andy was reasonable with us and did refund the painting cost which was a huge amount.",,,,,"Rahul, thank you for taking the time to provide thorough feedback.

We are so happy to hear that you enjoyed our efficient maintenance services.
At the same time, we are so sorry that you experienced these inconveniences.
We can certainly understand your frustration with the washer/dryer and security deposit.

Unfortunately, the building has only one washer and dryer hookup and it's not possible to install more given the electrical, plumbing, and space limitations of the building.
As for the security deposit, we have a high standard for the cleanliness of apartment units. The units must be fully cleaned according to the PDF that we sent you and the move-out procedures on our website: https://ugroupcu.com/move-in-move-out/

These procedures are the same steps that we go through to make sure the apartment is clean enough for a new renter or the unit must be professionally cleaned. In this case, cleaning was still necessary to make the unit move-in ready for the next tenant.

We want to say thank you for choosing to live with us.
Once again, we are sorry for the inconveniences that you experienced, Rahul.

Feel free to reach out to us if there is anything more we can do!

When I was touring their units, Rick took the time and showed me multiple units.  He was really responsive and followed up even after work hours when I had questions about the lease.  I just moved in this past week into one of their new apartments (Midtown Plaza).  The key hand-off was very smooth with the leasing office (they had everything prepared already before I arrived).  When I found some minor defects with the unit (this is expected with new constructions), the maintenance team was extremely responsive to get the issues resolved.  I was amazed at their professionalism and responsiveness.  Cameron, from the maintenance team, was very cordial and helped fixed a number of the issues.  The team also dispatched the general contractor out the same day to take care of any additional issues under warranty with the unit.  Cory and Jeremy from the maintenance team also followed up on my requests to make sure they were resolved successfully; this is the kind of professionalism I have not witnessed before from other property management groups.  I'm worry-free living at a University Group apartment, knowing there is a dependable maintenance team for any issues I may come across.

Update: I've been living here for 6 months and the experience is very stellar.  Putting in a maintenance request yesterday evening, someone came by to check out the issue this morning.  Everyone is friendly and professional.

Update: Living here for a year now.  Putting in 2 maintenance requests just this morning (light bulb burned out and lock needed some lubrication).  Staff came same day in the early afternoon to fix it.  Really appreciate the University Group staff.  (Note: University Group has an online portal which makes it easy to put in requests as well.)

10/03/19 Update: submitted a maintenance request for running toilet in bathroom. Provided permission to enter.  Next day I came back home, it was fixed. = responsive maintenance team!

1/14/20 update: submitted request for light bulb burned out in the afternoon yesterday. Came this morning and it's replaced.  = continued expeditious maintenance service turn-arounds.

They drain your security deposit with the most uncalled for reasons. They charged my roommate and I 300 dollars for painting. When we first moved in (602 E Stoughton) there was not fresh paint on the walls. We did not make the condition of the paint any worse. I also only lived there for 4/12 months of my lease due to a cockroach infestation that we noticed on day 2 after we moved in. I finally had to move back home and drop my in person classes because the cockroach problem was persistent. Another 175 for carpet cleaning which is an absurd amount for the amount of carpet in the apartment. And another 145 for general apartment cleaning even though we left the apartment very clean. Save yourselves the trouble and avoid signing with UGroup. I know rental agencies can be difficult to work with but this agency is impossible and takes advantage of its tenants every chance they can.,,,,,"Doris, thank you for taking the time to give us feedback in your review. We are so sorry that you had unexpected charges against your security deposit. We have eradicated the cockroach issue and will continue to do so should the need arise. We can see how all of this must have been frustrating.

We do have a high standard for the cleanliness of our apartment units. The units must be cleaned according to the move-out procedures on our website: https://ugroupcu.com/move-in-move-out/
These procedures are the same steps that we go through to make sure the apartment is clean enough for a new renter or it must be cleaned. Furthermore, carpet cleaning is stated on the lease as a standard charge for this apartment unit as it needs consistent cleaning to be move-in ready. In this case, some cleaning was still necessary to make the unit move-in ready.

I hope their new homes are much better.

Fortunately for me, my experience was interesting and overall ended positively. When I first walked in, the apartment had carpet on the living room floor and the place smelled a little funny, but everything looked sanitized within the last week (except for the blinds). Everything worked well, except for a half broken couch, and a few dining chairs that needed to be repaired.

The same day, I input my maintenance requests to get any items I found wrong to be fixed. Within three business days, everything was fixed with quality products and very promptly. I now have hard wood floors as was agreed on the lease and the place looks great! Especially with the new furniture provided.

All in all, although the initial impression wasn’t the greatest, the fact that maintenance was professional and prompt with each response showed that they understand the value of attending to their tenants. Shoutout to Cory for being so helpful during my first week back on campus and thanks to University Group for the quick action. Were it not for that, I would probably also be writing a poor review.

Would you be willing to reach out to us about this?

We have a high standard for the cleanliness of our apartment units. The units must be fully cleaned according to the move-out procedures on our website: https://ugroupcu.com/move-in-move-out/
These procedures are the same steps that we go through to make sure the apartment is clean enough for a new renter or the unit must be professionally cleaned.

We would be happy to discuss this with you.

I can’t say any other apartment managing companies are much better, but Ugroup and Healey place were majorly disappointing.",,,,,"Natalie, we are so sorry that you experienced these inconveniences.
As previously stated, unfortunately, the elevator was not a simple fix. A part of the elevator that needed to be replaced had to be custom made (fabrication itself took 4 weeks) resulting in longer downtime than we could have predicted. We wanted to make sure the elevator was completely safe and functional before it was used by the public again. The safety of our tenants is our number one priority. We are happy to report that the new part was installed and the elevator at Healey Place was returned to a safe, fully functional status as of around 9am this morning (August 3rd).
As for the cockroach issue, that's awful and we're so sorry that you experienced that, Natalie. We would like to hear more information so we can make sure this issue is resolved.
We would love to speak with you to understand what we can do better and for a chance to make this right. Please email us at Leasing@UGroupCU.com or call (217) 352-3182. We look forward to talking with you.

My interactions with the front office have been fairly limited, but they’ve been positive. In my experience they are really responsive to emails and accommodating to most concerns.
The maintenance team is easily the best I’ve ever experienced. They are very quick, usually making repairs the same day. The repairs have also been really thorough and better than you might expect. Most recently, a squeaky ceiling fan was replaced with a new model that looks great and runs whisper quiet. At my previous building, a caretaker lived on site. He did a fantastic job of making the space look great and clean, and quickly responding to repair and upkeep issues.
The unit I live in looks great, but I do wish the same level of upkeep were given to the building. The halls have old carpet and the staircases are exposed concrete with stains from spills over the years. It’s not the biggest issue, but it doesn’t give a great first impression to guests. A numerical keyless entry system was disabled about a year after moving into the building.

Meg lacks social skills and is very unprofessional and condescending. Someone in the reviews mentioned how she “had robotic responses” and I completely agree with that statement.

Be prepared to have half or more of your security deposit withheld for: “carpet cleaning, painting and cleaning”; what most lessors consider as normal wear and tear. *As we did live there for almost 3 years. It wouldn’t matter if you hired professionals to remodel the unit you rented before you moved out, you still wouldn’t receive your deposit back. I’m being sarcastic to make the point that you will never receive your full deposit back.

I received an email from Meg to see if it was okay to show the property to potential renters, which I was currently renting, DURING A WORLDWIDE PANDEMIC. However, I didn’t receive a courteous email about move out procedures. As Meg stated, “Move out procedures can be found on the website.”

The University group does not build relationships with their tenants. Tenants are strictly seen as business opportunities. I can tell they rent to a lot of college students as I received emails about leaving the temperature set to 62 degrees when not in the apartment. Theses emails didn’t apply to me as me and my family lived in their properties off campus.
A simple check-in/ anniversary email would have been nice to receive.

I WOULD NOT recommend anyone to rent from the University Group, EVER! This was my first and last time leasing from a company.

1. Our apartment was very dirty and only half painted when we moved in.  Our bathtub was pink, the kitchen floor was sticky and there was an inch of dust in the closets. Oh and by the way, we paid a $200 cleaning fee BEFORE moving in.

2. Moving out early ended up costing us much more than if we had just moved out and didn't turn in our keys. Apparently, someone came into our apartment a month after we moved out, set the ac to 62 degrees, turned the oven on, and opened up every faucet. We had to pay for 8,000 gallons of water and 4,000 kWh we didn't use. We literally paid more in utilities for the 3 months we weren't living there than the previous 8 months.

(See recent reviews about the elevator being broken). I live on the top floor and have been moving everything up and down the stairs alone. As someone who isn’t that strong, I have dropped things, sprained my ankle, and literally walked up over 100 flights of stairs over the past few days to move my stuff. The leasing office responded to a review that the elevator would be fixed by the move out date of August 3rd. Well, it’s August 3rd and the elevator is STILL not fixed. I do not recommend living at a University Group property. They are untrustworthy and clearly do not care about their residents. I have called several times about the elevator with my frustrations and never once did they offer any type of reparations or extensions for me to move my things out.",,,,,"QQ, it makes us sad to hear about your expereince with the elevator issue. We can certainly understand how frustrating it must have been to use the stairs to move all of your things.
As previously stated, unfortunately, the elevator was not a simple fix. A part of the elevator that needed to be replaced had to be custom made (fabrication itself took 4 weeks) resulting in longer downtime than we could have predicted. We wanted to make sure the elevator was completely safe and functional before it was used by the public again. The safety of our tenants is our number one priority. We are happy to report that the new part was installed and the elevator at Healey Place was returned to a safe, fully functional status as of around 9am this morning (August 3rd).
Once again, we are so sorry for the many inconveniences you've had to experience with the elevator being out of operation. Could you reach out to us one more time? We would love to speak with you for a chance to make this right. Please email us at Leasing@UGroupCU.com or call (217) 352-3182. We look forward to hearing from you, QQ.

After five days submitting the request, he came in with ""So your dryer is not working AGAIN?"" And would not listen to me but kept saying ""I have 20 years of experience working on dryers."" ""It is very normal for a dryer to run two cycles to get the clothes dry.""

To be fair, the apartments are very nice but the elevator issue has been ridiculous. The elevator at our apartment complex has been broken for over a month. OVER A MONTH. I’ve had to walk up 7 flights of stairs from my car to my apartment every single day. That itself is annoying but the worst part is there are 5 days until my lease ends and the elevator still isn’t fixed. If this elevator isn’t fixed within the next day or two, I don’t know how I’m going to move all of my stuff out and down 7 flights of stairs. It’s been a stress not for me, but plenty of other residents in the complex.

I understand there needing to be time for repair but this has been egregiously long. They emailed us saying it would be fixed this week, but yet it is not. This whole elevator issue ruins any good aspects of the Healey Place or University Group.",,,,,"Noah, we are very sorry to hear that the elevator issue at Healey Place has been so challenging. I'm sure it has been frustrating to have to use the stairs for a month. Unfortunately, it is not a simple fix and we want to make sure the elevator is completely safe and functional before it's used by the public again. We are working tirelessly to have the elevator fixed well before your move-out date coming up on August 3!
Once again, we're so sorry for all of the inconveniences you've had to experience with the elevator being down. We would love to speak with you for a chance to make this right. Please email maintenance at Maintenance@UGroupCU.com or call (217) 352-1472. We look forward to hearing from you regarding this.

It is rather unfortunate that the overgenerous Google rating system doesn't allow for negative stars. Renting from these people can become a nightmare of biblical proportions. AVOID. Many reviews mention the shady practice of offering tenants a dirty apartment when moving in, while still charging hundreds upon hundreds of dollars worth of the ""cleaning"" they never do, upon moving out. They've been called on it innumerable times, but they continue this banana republic, corrupt practice. They even respond to reviews with great ""innocence"" but recidivate over and over and over again. Greed, dishonesty, incompetence, and shamelessness are just the polite ones among the attributes which define ""university group"". If you don't value your health, by all means go ahead and rent. If there are 5 degrees out there and your heating breaks, or if there are 100 degrees and the AC fails, they will do NOTHING for many long days, not to mention the insolent, callous, crude attitude of the employees, when you ""dare"" to complain.

On rare occasions, our system charges incorrectly. If you do not have carpet then you will receive a refund for that charge. Please email us at the email below if you do not receive that in the coming weeks.
We have a high standard for the cleanliness of our apartment units. The units must be cleaned according to the move-out procedures on our website: https://ugroupcu.com/move-in-move-out/
Once again, we are sorry that the charges were unexpected.
Our team aims to serve our tenants with a high standard of excellence.
Could you reach out to us one more time?
We would love to speak with you for a chance to make this right. Please email us at Account.Inquiries@UGroupCU.com. We look forward to hearing from you, Kevin.

We made the mistake of continuing the lease with UGroup. They've done it again. Scammed $400 from our security deposit. The reason is ""cleaning"". Literally the bill attached to our security deposit check had ""cleaning - $408.25"" and NO explanation. I called them for an explanation and they haven't gotten back to me for a month now! Avoid leasing with Ugroup if you can! They love scamming.

Edit (2017):

I got part of the deposit back. It took sometime, but they got back to me because they wanted me to take down this review.

Original post:

Maintenance response is good. But they scam the deposit and when asked about it they said there is a huge wait to meet with the managers to talk about it, which just confirms that there are lot of victims here.

When in reality, I called my management company to get an escalation on a work order that has not been completed to date.  And then Beverly decided to hang up on me.

When I called back Beverly picked up the phone and I informed her that I just called in relation to a work order and she hung up on me.  Beverly responded with, ""I didn't hang up on you, I transferred you.""  I basically went back and forth with Beverly as if I were a child in grade school about the fact that earlier she told me that I had to call the Maintenance number, she responded with you do.  I personally, do not know how someone so trite and just plain ignorant who has zero to no customers service skills whatsoever could be given the responsibility to pick up the phone and represent a company that is reliant on the appreciation of customers.  Not only did Beverly not provide me with adequate customer support but even if she were to hint a smidge of frustration over my end in relation to my outstanding work order to not take my name, unit, and phone number to try to escalate the issue that has been an issue for so long but to just hang up on me, and may I add prior to actually even providing me with the maintenance phone number is by far one of the worst forms of customer support I have ever had the experience of enduring.  Not only that but to be a representative of an industry that is reliant on customers informing them of property conditions and to be non-shalant about a property issue and doesnt do anything to assist in preserving  property is unfair to customers who reside in properties.",,,,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwbU11MVR3EAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x7081e12f4c1e30f5!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIC0mMu1Tw%7CCgwIs_bv6wUQoM_Z1wE%7C?hl=en-US,1,1568406323,09/13/2019 20:25:23,12,8107008397500362997,200,17,10,38,399

Yup, it's working, but with abnormal noise which is loud that all visitors can hear and say 'it's really annoying' :(

If you want to live in University Group apartment, you might have to endure some inconvenience or uncomfortable atmosphere, or maybe somehow dangerous environment to your health, in your unit. They might not response to your request and say ""We have nothing to do with that""

---------------
Regarding the response posted on 3/15/2021 by the University Group,

I've already requested 3 times and called 2 times for this issue and the University Group rejected the second look. All I got from the University group was ""We don’t replace appliances that are in normal working order. Just because it may be an older model doesn’t mean it gets replaced if it’s working as it should"".

The point is, I'm not saying the device is ""old"". The device creates ""NOISE"" that one of technicians from the University Group can't hear. The device (refrigerator) is 21 years old, but not all 20-year-old refrigerators have this kind of sound. All my friends were surprised for the fact that there exists a technician who says ""It's a normal sound"" after hearing such ""NOISE"". In common sense, a device operating with an abnormal ""NOISE"" should be fixed.

FYI: According to the United States Department of Energy, refrigerators last approximately 12 years. At that point, it's likely time to replace it.

I just want to inform the condition of appliances of the University Group and the maintenance service quality to future customers.",,,,,"Jun, this is never what we want to hear. Please come see us at the office, email us at leasing@ugroupcu.com, or call (217) 352-3182 and we'd welcome the chance to take a second look at what's going on here.

We are sorry that these charges were unexpected.

However, we have a high standard for the cleanliness of our apartment units. The units must be cleaned according to the move-out procedures on our website: https://ugroupcu.com/move-in-move-out/
Those move-out procedures are the same steps that we take to make sure the apartment is clean enough for a new renter or it must be cleaned.

We would love to speak with you about this to see how we might improve.

We would be happy to resend the offer to you.

Once again, we are so sorry for the furniture delays.
Our furniture providers have been extremely backordered due to COVID-19 which is, unfortunately, out of our control.

On rare occasions, our system charges incorrectly. If you do not have carpet then you will receive a refund for that charge. Please email us at the email below if you do not receive that in the coming weeks.

As for any other charges, we have a high standard for the cleanliness of our apartment units. The units must be cleaned according to the move-out procedures on our website: https://ugroupcu.com/move-in-move-out/
These procedures are the same steps that we go through to make sure the apartment is clean enough for a new renter or it must be professionally cleaned before the next tenant moves in.

Please let us know if you do not receive your carpet cleaning refund!
