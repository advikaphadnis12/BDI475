I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to discuss the deductions made from my security deposit for my tenancy at 1107 S Fourth, Unit 3 during the last academic year.

Upon reviewing the itemized list of deductions, I noted the following charges:

Paint and repair: $400
Cleaning: $880
Item Removal: $350
Carpet cleaning: $205

The total deductions amount (1835 dollars) is a substantial portion of my security deposit. My roommate and I have not caused any damage to the property nor have we left a mess for you to clean. As a tenant, I am entitled to transparency regarding these charges. I request the provision of receipts for each service that was allegedly carried out. This is not only to verify the costs but also to ensure that these services were conducted by legitimate and operational businesses.

Having consulted with my school's legal services, I've been informed that I have the right to request and review these receipts. To expedite the resolution of this matter, I propose two options:

1, Kindly provide me with the respective receipts for the aforementioned services. (I'll send it to my attorney to validate the legitimacy of the company and its service)
2, Alternatively, I am willing to accept a refund of 80% of my original security deposit, and we can consider the matter resolved.

Should I not receive the requested receipts or the proposed refund within a reasonable timeframe, I want to inform you that I am prepared to escalate the matter. While I genuinely hope to resolve this amicably, I will not hesitate to seek legal recourse through my school's attorney to ensure my rights as a tenant are upheld.

I trust that we can come to a satisfactory resolution promptly. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Warm regards,
Peter Chen",,,,,"Peter, thank you for your detailed and thoughtful review. 
Your thorough approach is appreciated. 
We are really sorry that you had unexpected charges on your security deposit.

At the same time, we have a high standard for cleanliness and we do provide all of our tenants with cleaning guidelines before turning in the keys that were not followed in this case. Therefore, the charges were necessary. 

Should you have any other questions, we would be happy to discuss this with you further, Peter.

I recommend MHM Properties; I personally had good experience with them.

UPDATE: We eventually got back $185 painting and $135 for cleaning, but that is only because we have fought with them over a month. They charged us for food debris left in kitchen cabinets, but we have cleaned every single cabinet even those ones above the microwave/fridge that we had never used during the whole lease term. In their videos, there is no proof of food stains/debris, etc. We have to show them our video where I literally opened every cabinet and show each one is thoroughly cleaned (INSANE, RIGHT?). They also charged us for floor cleaning fees in the bedrooms, but the bedrooms are ALL carpets, and they have already charged $175 for carpet cleaning. They claimed that carpet cleaning is only for steaming carpet, and floor cleaning means vacuuming. I dont why they can double charged you for the same service. We did vacuum the carpets (even though we knew we are charged with carpet cleaning fees), and there are even vacuum traces left on the carpet in the photos shown <- This is the only reason we got money back on this. I guess they are somewhat reasonable, but it is still very painful to put so much effort in cleaning, take photos and videos of literally everything (including base board), argue with them (they respond once a week...), and only get back a fraction of your well-deserved money.

We also got charged for $175 carpeting, $220 cleaning and $185 painting out of security deposit when we moved out. I have attached some photos of the move-out condition; we also took some videos including but not limited to the interior of fridge, microwave, oven, cabinet, closet, windows, mirrors, sinks, etc. It is actually even cleaner than move-in condition since we moved in early and this was the new construction.
We have no issue with carpet cleaning fees as we were aware of it prior to signing the lease. It’s just interesting to point out that the estimate costs of carpet cleaning on the lease varies from the size of rooms, but most of my friends got charged $175 regardless of the unit.
There is no detail of what is cleaned, which wall needs to be re-painted on the invoice. I heard that some people got charged with carpet cleaning fees but they didn’t even have carpet inside their units, so I wildly guess they just sent the same invoice to a certain group of people regardless of each tenant’s unit condition. I requested a move-out video taken from their inspectors, so far no replies.

We also experienced many other issues people mentioned in their reviews: we signed an unit which was planned to finish remodeling before the early move-in date (and was confirmed by the leasing agent), but it didn’t due to COVID. We eventually got rearranged to this nicer apartment. When we moved in, there was no furniture and not cleaned at all. A bunch of glue-like stuff and paint stains were on the floor/island/bathtub and splinters/dusts from construction were everywhere. Our doors are not properly installed and cannot be fixed by the maintenance team, so we cannot close the door without making noise. We got our bar stools one and half month after move-in date and we never get the TV stand as promised on the lease and in the email conversations.

We have wall painting damage under the electricity box only because the unit above us decided to flood their restroom with water, and somehow we (and one of the maintenance staff, I thank him for dealing with this issue very promptly) are affected by that and had to lose over a half night of sleep on Sunday midnight, due to some flaws of the building structure. We lost electricity the whole night including the fridge and other major appliances. Water keeps dripping down into the electric box; it was scary (see attached photo).",https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMeBoknIYx8jx_C6DDpXzlng8SV3YANFPrYmYN,"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMeBoknIYx8jx_C6DDpXzlng8SV3YANFPrYmYN, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPJ9M1nqD5HtfvWoHD4AKjlbpbxSeqMrqktwuWr, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMVM5xpyED2FIroOm5vqsG-69wTUlMJa-Oopy_n, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOx3plzmRkSurvSudvDFmJO94u9mBwUx3nHoJ5Z, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNKzCXGqy2nu8NtL58KbW41mrY2jGiNaIuQaiyO, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOPY7vMGUSB0CL7AAoOJGR5Zx4j6gWamusab_yv, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNXWIchMwPlwCk9wAMemgzo5XCYcAxjpRMbvlaD",,"AF1QipMMeBoknIYx8jx_C6DDpXzlng8SV3YANFPrYmYN, AF1QipPJ9M1nqD5HtfvWoHD4AKjlbpbxSeqMrqktwuWr, AF1QipMVM5xpyED2FIroOm5vqsG-69wTUlMJa-Oopy_n, AF1QipOx3plzmRkSurvSudvDFmJO94u9mBwUx3nHoJ5Z, AF1QipNKzCXGqy2nu8NtL58KbW41mrY2jGiNaIuQaiyO, AF1QipOPY7vMGUSB0CL7AAoOJGR5Zx4j6gWamusab_yv, AF1QipNXWIchMwPlwCk9wAMemgzo5XCYcAxjpRMbvlaD","Linz, thank you for taking the time to leave us feedback. We are so sorry that these charges were unexpected. We can certainly understand how these issues must have been frustrating.

We are known for our quick maintenance service. I'm glad that we had someone on-site quickly for the flooding issue. I am very sorry that you experienced challenges with your unit. Our maintenance team does the very best they can to resolve issues in a timely manner.

As for the security deposit, we have a high standard for the cleanliness of our apartment units. The units must be cleaned according to the move-out procedures on our website. ( https://ugroupcu.com/move-in-move-out/ ) These procedures are the same steps that we go through to make sure the apartment is clean enough for a new renter or it must be cleaned.

In regards to the carpet cleaning fee in apartments that do not have carpet, on rare occasions, our system incorrectly charges tenants. In those cases, the tenants are refunded the carpet cleaning fee.

We take making our units ready for the next tenant very seriously.
Once again, we are sorry that the charges were unexpected.
Our team aims to serve our tenants with a high standard of excellence.

We would love to speak with you about this to see how we might improve.
Please email us at Account.Inquiries@UGroupCU.com.
We look forward to hearing from you.

THEY WILL ROB YOUR CHILDREN BLIND!!!  WATER LEAKING FROM THE ROOF. NO HOT WATER- NO HEAT.
This was a first time renting experience for our children.  They were taken advantage of.  As parents were unable to help. We were not on the lease.
Did walk thru after move out.There were no issues.  My daughter received an email today, that they were going to keep half of the security deposit, 600+ dollars for normal wear and tear, and the cost to repaint for the next set of tenants. The staff are U of I students.  And they are taught to rob their fellow class mates.  To be rude, and hung up on .   They should be ashamed of themselves.  People treated people this way.  This is not how professional people work.  They are learning skills that will get them nowhere. Maintenance went into their   apt over the break when no one is there- changed the heat settings/fan settings- without tenants' knowledge. Once the bill comes it's triple the amount of money.  And no one is even there. They were home on break.  Again, no response from leasing group.  Bill had to be paid.
Plenty of other rental buildings to go rent from.  Spare your child the trauma.  THIS GROUP WILL ROB YOU OF AS MUCH MONEY AS THEY CAN. !!!  They are unreachable.  Made several trips from Chicago to see someone face to face.  Impossible!.  They intimidated our children.  INFURIATING!! And they wouldn't dare speak to us as parents, because they know we won't be intimidated.  Their favorite saying.. ""you are not on the lease"". I can only imagine how many times they have been sued. !! Most of us walk away.. Lesson learned.. Our kids - who pay this rent with their own money, are traumatized.  I live in a big city. And have never come across such low life people, preying on young college kids.
You can never speak to management, just students.  Emails never answered.  Just pay them their money, or they will continue to add on charges. Maybe if enough people write reviews, which I see there are quite a lot .  People will keep away. I only wished that we had read them, prior to our kids signing a lease. This building is under code.  So many issues.. Check the city records... People get found out eventually.

The person that was living there had several allies on help with rent being paid,,,,,"Meleka, thank you for leaving us feedback here. 
We're sure these charges were stressful and unexpected. 

However, the charges were due to three major breaches of our policies: 
1) You continued to live in the apartment past the lease end date
2) Belongings were left in the apartment seven months after the lease end date.
3) Your vehicle was left on the premises seven months after the lease end date. 

Due to these issues:
1) No one else could move into the apartment and we had to charge for rent for those seven months
2) The vehicle had to be towed 

Furthermore, we have it on record that you did sign the lease, and our policies were made known to you. 
Again, we're sure that these events were stressful and challenging but because there were no payments made and the belongings were not moved out to remedy these breaches of policy, we had no other choice. 
As such, the total balance of $5,704.25 was sent to collections.

If you have any questions please email us at leasing@ugroupcu.com. 

We wish you all the best, Meleka.

Do not lease with them!

Apartment had black mold on windows, and maintenance told me there was nothing to be done.

The previous tenant left furniture and personal belongings behind and it was made my responsibility to clean. In addition, the sinks were filthy upon move in and so badly clogged with hair that not more than a couple drops of water could drain.

In addition, the carpet smelled musty and had clumps of hair in some spots. As someone who has worked cleaning carpets professionally in the past, this was most definitely not cleaned correctly. It was very clear that their “professional” cleaning services weren’t thorough in any regard.

Drywall was damaged and had signs of leaking when I moved in and after noting it, it was promised to be repaired. Not once was it addressed in the entire 12 months of the lease.

Multiple water leaks that destroyed personal belongings and they left open holes in ceiling for the remaining duration of the lease.

And I wouldn’t recommend parking your car near their structures. A piece of the ceiling came off and fell on my car and they acknowledged that it was a problem that they were aware of, but didn’t fix.

In the winter they took an absurd amount of time to ever clear the snow, even when all other apartments were cleared, University Group simply kept saying they had so many properties and that they were going to get to us eventually.

And of course to top it all off, they are withholding almost $500 of the security deposit for damages that do not exist, and in fact they caused themselves. While trying to contact them they are extremely hard to get any response from and very rude over the phone.

If you want a nice place to live, without mold and constant maintenance nightmares, look elsewhere!!!!

And if you’ve already made the mistake of leasing with them and lost a big chunk of your security deposit, I suggest contacting the university student legal services!

UPDATE: If you get your security deposit check, look at the invoices. They are using these companies to make fake invoices, it is clear as day!

EDIT: Notice in their reply they avoided addressing all of the other things besides their cleaning fees. They are a dishonest company, it’s very clear. They hit me with every charge and walked back on some once I pressed them.",,,,,"Adrian, thank you for taking time to give us feedback. 
We are so sorry that you experienced unexpected charges. 
We can understand your frustration and the feedback you've provided is helpful. However, charges were necessary in this case. Please see below. 

We have a high standard for the cleanliness of our apartment units. The units must be fully cleaned according to the move-out procedures on our website: https://ugroupcu.com/move-in-move-out/
These procedures are the same steps that we go through to make sure the apartment is clean enough for a new renter or the unit must be professionally cleaned. In this case, cleaning was still necessary to make the unit move-in ready for the next tenant. You can see the move-out condition video here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uzkUHECi9pOCcs6m37ObSxPNy9U09D2l/view?usp=sharing

They refuse to put cameras and their communications about this have been horrible. It’s basically “not our problem, call the police” type response.

I received a package vie fedex this Monday and asked if they could pick it up for me since it’s valuable and I will not be in town to do so myself. I even offered to send an email releasing them of all and any liability. They refused to do so. Surely enough, by the time I came back to my apartment on Wednesday, someone already tore open the package, stole the content and left the opened bag in the lobby.

Thanks UGroup. Don’t even respond to this email with the fake “we take reviews seriously” because your actions have proven otherwise.",,,,,"Hello Haris, it's a real bummer that your package got taken. That is the worst. We're really sorry this happened. 

As a policy, we don't put packages into apartments due to security and liability reasons. 
We also do not have enough staff members to manage package delivery effectively. The building that you are living in is a secure building so someone must have stolen it from inside of the secure building. 

The fact is that cameras are often not feasible which is why not all buildings have them. Furthermore, in order for the cameras to be effective, you have to be able to see the face of the person (most people stealing packages wear masks). 

Nonetheless, package theft is an issue for every apartment building (we've talked with several others) and it is very hard to prevent and prosecute. 
This is why Amazon, FedEx, etc, have lockers and pick-up points.
 Again, it's extremely unfortunate that this happened. 
We really wish there was more we could do to help you, Haris.

That being said, we have a high standard for the cleanliness of our apartment units. The units must be cleaned according to the move-out procedures on our website: https://ugroupcu.com/move-in-move-out/
These procedures are the same steps that we go through to make sure the apartment is clean enough for a new renter or it must be professionally cleaned before the next tenant moves in.
We would be happy to speak with you about this. You can see from the video at the link below that cleaning was still necessary in this case: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sjhCddLZlf1UrLsAvwO9iOQcHsecNZuq/view?usp=sharing

Some of the companies that they contracted to “Clean” your apartment after move out as well as “Paint” your apartment  have little to no contact information to follow up on the exaggerated amount they charged as those fees. The company they used to Clean doesn’t show up on Illinois state Secretary as a registered business at all which is super sus.

I was charged from my security deposit $600 in “cleaning charges” when I cleaned for hours before I moved out and $300 “painting charges” for normal wear and tear. Looking at the reviews, it seems like they did this to every tenant they had. Awful company to rent with who doesn’t care about anything except stealing from students and taking advantage of renters because they don’t think they’ll fight back.

Edit: Very VERY strange for a leasing company to post publicly a woman’s former address and a video of her former apartment online for anyone to see. Clearly this company doesn’t care about their tenants privacy or safety either. Also, I don’t think the video shows $600 worth of cleaning and $300 worth of damage, but I digress.",,,,,"Madeline, thank you for taking the time to give us feedback.
We are so sorry that you experienced unexpected charges.
We can certainly understand your frustration.

We have a high standard for the cleanliness of our apartment units. The units must be fully cleaned according to the move-out procedures on our website: https://ugroupcu.com/move-in-move-out/
These procedures are the same steps that we go through to make sure the apartment is clean enough for a new renter or the unit must be professionally cleaned.
As you'll see in the move-out video below, work was necessary to make the unit move-in ready for the next tenant.

That's my sad experience with them, we were charged ~1150 for cleaning, while the monthly rent is ~450 per person. That was several years ago, and I was kind enough to think it was my own problem at that time, until I heard stories from others in these years.
I've been in Champaign for more than 5 years now, and have experienced multiple companies, cpm, jsm, green st, etc, only University Group charge this amount of cleaning (Not to mention that when I moved in, there are rotten food in the fridge that smells like ****, despite the expensive ""cleaning"" they did).

We are sorry that you experienced unexpected charges.
We can certainly understand your frustration.

We have a high standard for the cleanliness of our apartment units. The units must be fully cleaned according to the move-out procedures on our website: https://ugroupcu.com/move-in-move-out/
These procedures are the same steps that we go through to make sure the apartment is clean enough for a new renter or the unit must be professionally cleaned. In this case, cleaning was still necessary to make the unit move-in ready for the next tenant.
Here is the video showing the condition of the apartment after move-out: https://drive.google.com/file/d/11_3xYMPSJsJlDzhm74nz23Y3ot00lUvE/view?usp=sharing

Ugroup charged me $600+ by listing only ""cleaning"" and ""painting"" on their invoices billed by vendors - note, these are invoices, not receipts. They did not list the specific damages I incurred to warrant such a high cost. I emailed three weeks ago and got no reply (same thing happened to many).

In response to your comments below:
1 - Your lease lists the carpet cleaning charges as ""estimates"", not ""minimum"", and so far it seems you often, if not always, charge people an amount much higher than these estimates without any justification

2 - We do not know whether you actually paid the said amount on invoice, if ever

3 - Even if you do, what the tenants are responsible for are the damages THEY caused, not how much YOU paid for.

4 - You take detailed videos of the units in each turnover, why not release them to tenants?

5 - Why do you insist on charging carpet cleaning fees to former tenants even though the vendor actually skipped that unit by mistake? And why do you charge $1000 in painting fees when the old tenants dropped by and found no new painting at all?

Lastly, just some food for thought as inspiration for business practice:

We’re very sorry that you had unexpected charges. However, these charges were necessary because we have high standards for cleanliness and we had to prepare the unit for the next tenant.

Edit: Updated to 3 stars. Maintenance is great, but beware of charges on your deposit. I was charged a carpet cleaning fee even though my apartment had all wooden floor. I was also charged for wall painting even though I've already had maintenance come in to paint the walls and ceilings 2 times. The building was one of the oldest ones on campus.
TLDR; maintenance is great, but beware of charges on your deposit, be prepared to take lots of photos.

The issue was completely resolved and the furnace was returned to a fully functional status on December 6, 2021.
As for the furniture, our furniture supplier and their supply chain has been backed up due to COVID-19. We will deliver the furniture as soon as our supplier is able to break through the bottleneck.

Update: We went to the office and they said there is no one else to talk about this except this one guy in charge of that  email address. We can not call him either. We can either sue them or just wait. Can you believe that? Please guys do not trust them when considering leasing!!

This is most terrible experience during my years of stay in CU area! Definitely a ripoff! Our deposit is 1480 dollars and they took 1145 from it. When moving out, we cleaned the apartment like shining and recorded video as proof. However, they charged 1145 in total for cleaning. This is nonsense. Where is that wall painting 370 dollars come from since there is no dirt on the wall at all? How come you charge a unit way much cleaner than its move in condition for 600 dollars? How come you charge carpet cleaning for 175 dollars when we did carpet cleaning ourselves?  We have video proof and they do not respond to our email to the account inquires service address at all. Now We wonder if we shall seek for legal service help that the university offers.",,,,,"Qian, thank you for taking the time to give the feedback that you provided here. We are so sorry that you experienced unexpected charges. We can certainly understand your frustration.

We have a high standard for the cleanliness of our apartment units. The units must be cleaned according to the move-out procedures on our website: https://ugroupcu.com/move-in-move-out/
These procedures are the same steps that we go through to make sure the apartment is clean enough for a new renter or it must be cleaned. In this case, a significant amount of cleaning was still necessary for the unit to be move-in ready for the next tenant. Furthermore, carpet cleaning is stated on the lease as a standard charge for this apartment unit as it needs consistent cleaning to be move-in ready.

We would be happy to speak with you about this to see how we might improve.

Situation:
University Group has left me with no functional washer since the beginning of my lease. When I contacted them to tell them this is not right neither fair, and that I consider it part of the rent I pay, they said:
a) The washer is included, but the rent is for the apartment and not the washer itself.
b) I should be able to Google and find washers near campus myself while I am waiting for the issue to be fixed. They did not consider it as their responsibility.
Also, they were interrupting me and being rude towards me. When I told them this is not okay they hung up the phone on me. When I called them back to report the incident, they also hang up on me. When I sent them an e-mail about this, they never replied back.

First, they are very soft on people who break the rules. I had a party person living in the unit right above me and she was having party every weekend. The noise was crazy loud in the midnight. Some policeman came and even that police officer know that party person and the officer told me that person in notorious in the area. They even had people yelling in the balcony and smoking weeds. I reported to the University Group office and they keep saying they've let that person know but they can't really do anything. I was expecting they to start an eviction process to that person but nothing really happened. She only got fined by the police once.

Second, they didn't tell me that other tenant has taken our unit in the new semester year and they never asked us if we wanted to extend our contract. I asked them why they did that and they just told me I was having a short term lease but in fact my lease was 10-month. And I had been living in midtown plaza for 3 years.

Last but not least, they will charge you a lot of money when you leave their property no matter how hard you clean the unit. My deposit was 600 and it was all taken. They told me to charge me extra 600 for painting and cleaning.

Just do everything you could to avoid the University Group and their properties.",,,,,"Yi, thank you for taking the time to provide feedback.
We are so sorry that you experienced these inconveniences with us.
We can certainly understand your frustration here.

We are aware of the loud tenant that lived near you at Midtown Plaza. We were pleased that the police were able to get involved and intervene with at least a ticket. We would have proceeded with the eviction process to evict the tenant, however, the current COVID-19 eviction moratorium issued by the state of Illinois did not allow us to evict that person despite their behavior. We certainly wish there was more that we could have done to stop the tenant from disturbing the peace for you and other tenants that followed the noise rules. We share your frustration that it was not possible to evict the tenant.

As for the security deposit, we have a high standard for the cleanliness of our apartment units. The units must be fully cleaned according to the move-out procedures on our website: https://ugroupcu.com/move-in-move-out/
These procedures are the same steps that we go through to make sure the apartment is clean enough for a new renter or the unit must be professionally cleaned. In this case, cleaning was still necessary to make the unit move-in ready for the next tenant.

If something is wrong with your house, they will use excuses. Not recommended.

Update/Answer to Univ. Group (Aug 25, 2021):

-- Regarding the furniture: You should have a Plan B, which you clearly do not. This is your problem, not your supplier's.
- The 1/2 month rent credit does not correspond to the damage you cause when all furniture (including the bed) are missing.
- You provided a washer that was not properly tested in advance, so when I tried to use it, it just did not work. You are aware of this issue, and cannot provide an estimated day on when it will be fixed.  The only thing you told me is that you will try your best and that the City of Champaign gives you up to 30 days to respond to my request.

Thanks for leaving me without a way to wash my clothes, and without furniture! At least you did a 1/2 month rent discount --while others would argue your company did not deserve to even get the other half.

So yes, there are things that you can do: start maybe by seeing your maintenance list and prioritizing the requests accordingly, hire more people, do a better job.",,,,,"Antonis, we are so sorry about the inconveniences you have experienced with the furniture delays. Although we ordered furniture one year ago, our supplier has experienced many unforeseen delays caused by COVID-19. We were happy to see that you received the 1/2 month rent credit that we sent on August 18 to say that we are so sorry for the inconveniences you've experienced. We will keep you informed as we have updates in regards to this.
Is there anything else we can do for you?

I lived at 706 S 1st for 2 years and overall the stay was fine. Honestly this building is pretty old as compared to other properties and that was evident with the appliances etc provided to us and one could see that after looking at the overall building condition. We requested and got the couch as well as the mattresses changed since they were in a bad condition and Ugroup did that without charging us any extra amount.

However the biggest problem for us was the laundry.  While most buildings have card operated laundry , our building had just 1 old coin slot washer and dryer and every month the coin circuit would get blocked and we had to raise a complain. On asking Ugroup for a new card operated machine, they mentioned it was upto coinmach(the machine providers) to replace it and when I spoke to coinmach they said it was upto Ugroup to raise a request, so basically a dead end. For more than 3 months in the winter of 2020, our building laundry was out of service and we were forced to do laundry in another building which was a big pain specially in peak winter months where we had to carry our clothes while it was freezing outside. We did complain but Ugroup simply mentioned that we need to get in touch with coinmach since they are the ones who own the machines. After making literally 20+ calls to coinmach over a span of 3 months, our machine was repaired and all this was without the help of Ugroup. However towards the end of our lease , we again faced problems and were without our dryer for a month and Ugroup simply said they couldn't do anything. When you have just 1 washer and 1 dryer in a building of 20+ residents, this inconvenience is unbearable. Ugroup should have a better alternative in such situations because we certainly are paying them the rent for residing in their building and not coinmach.

As far as the security deposit is concerned, Andy from the accounts team was super helpful. They had charged us for apartment painting but after showing the before move in and before move out photos, we got the full amount refunded to us. They did charge us for carpet cleaning and other cleaning charges which were a bit higher due to covid as per Ugroup, however it was still not that bad when I see other tenant reviews. They do send you a PDF that has all the breakdown of the cleaning charges and they also send you videos of areas/things that needed extreme cleaning, so that was certainly helpful. The carpet cleaning was $50 extra than what was estimated in the lease (covid was given as the reason) but our apartment cleaning charges were a bit more that what I expected. Overall I'm just happy atleast Andy was reasonable with us and did refund the painting cost which was a huge amount.",,,,,"Rahul, thank you for taking the time to provide thorough feedback.

We are so happy to hear that you enjoyed our efficient maintenance services.
At the same time, we are so sorry that you experienced these inconveniences.
We can certainly understand your frustration with the washer/dryer and security deposit.

Unfortunately, the building has only one washer and dryer hookup and it's not possible to install more given the electrical, plumbing, and space limitations of the building.
As for the security deposit, we have a high standard for the cleanliness of apartment units. The units must be fully cleaned according to the PDF that we sent you and the move-out procedures on our website: https://ugroupcu.com/move-in-move-out/

These procedures are the same steps that we go through to make sure the apartment is clean enough for a new renter or the unit must be professionally cleaned. In this case, cleaning was still necessary to make the unit move-in ready for the next tenant.

We want to say thank you for choosing to live with us.
Once again, we are sorry for the inconveniences that you experienced, Rahul.

Feel free to reach out to us if there is anything more we can do!

When I was touring their units, Rick took the time and showed me multiple units.  He was really responsive and followed up even after work hours when I had questions about the lease.  I just moved in this past week into one of their new apartments (Midtown Plaza).  The key hand-off was very smooth with the leasing office (they had everything prepared already before I arrived).  When I found some minor defects with the unit (this is expected with new constructions), the maintenance team was extremely responsive to get the issues resolved.  I was amazed at their professionalism and responsiveness.  Cameron, from the maintenance team, was very cordial and helped fixed a number of the issues.  The team also dispatched the general contractor out the same day to take care of any additional issues under warranty with the unit.  Cory and Jeremy from the maintenance team also followed up on my requests to make sure they were resolved successfully; this is the kind of professionalism I have not witnessed before from other property management groups.  I'm worry-free living at a University Group apartment, knowing there is a dependable maintenance team for any issues I may come across.

Update: I've been living here for 6 months and the experience is very stellar.  Putting in a maintenance request yesterday evening, someone came by to check out the issue this morning.  Everyone is friendly and professional.

Update: Living here for a year now.  Putting in 2 maintenance requests just this morning (light bulb burned out and lock needed some lubrication).  Staff came same day in the early afternoon to fix it.  Really appreciate the University Group staff.  (Note: University Group has an online portal which makes it easy to put in requests as well.)

10/03/19 Update: submitted a maintenance request for running toilet in bathroom. Provided permission to enter.  Next day I came back home, it was fixed. = responsive maintenance team!

1/14/20 update: submitted request for light bulb burned out in the afternoon yesterday. Came this morning and it's replaced.  = continued expeditious maintenance service turn-arounds.

They drain your security deposit with the most uncalled for reasons. They charged my roommate and I 300 dollars for painting. When we first moved in (602 E Stoughton) there was not fresh paint on the walls. We did not make the condition of the paint any worse. I also only lived there for 4/12 months of my lease due to a cockroach infestation that we noticed on day 2 after we moved in. I finally had to move back home and drop my in person classes because the cockroach problem was persistent. Another 175 for carpet cleaning which is an absurd amount for the amount of carpet in the apartment. And another 145 for general apartment cleaning even though we left the apartment very clean. Save yourselves the trouble and avoid signing with UGroup. I know rental agencies can be difficult to work with but this agency is impossible and takes advantage of its tenants every chance they can.,,,,,"Doris, thank you for taking the time to give us feedback in your review. We are so sorry that you had unexpected charges against your security deposit. We have eradicated the cockroach issue and will continue to do so should the need arise. We can see how all of this must have been frustrating.

We do have a high standard for the cleanliness of our apartment units. The units must be cleaned according to the move-out procedures on our website: https://ugroupcu.com/move-in-move-out/
These procedures are the same steps that we go through to make sure the apartment is clean enough for a new renter or it must be cleaned. Furthermore, carpet cleaning is stated on the lease as a standard charge for this apartment unit as it needs consistent cleaning to be move-in ready. In this case, some cleaning was still necessary to make the unit move-in ready.

I hope their new homes are much better.

Fortunately for me, my experience was interesting and overall ended positively. When I first walked in, the apartment had carpet on the living room floor and the place smelled a little funny, but everything looked sanitized within the last week (except for the blinds). Everything worked well, except for a half broken couch, and a few dining chairs that needed to be repaired.

The same day, I input my maintenance requests to get any items I found wrong to be fixed. Within three business days, everything was fixed with quality products and very promptly. I now have hard wood floors as was agreed on the lease and the place looks great! Especially with the new furniture provided.

All in all, although the initial impression wasn’t the greatest, the fact that maintenance was professional and prompt with each response showed that they understand the value of attending to their tenants. Shoutout to Cory for being so helpful during my first week back on campus and thanks to University Group for the quick action. Were it not for that, I would probably also be writing a poor review.

Would you be willing to reach out to us about this?

We have a high standard for the cleanliness of our apartment units. The units must be fully cleaned according to the move-out procedures on our website: https://ugroupcu.com/move-in-move-out/
These procedures are the same steps that we go through to make sure the apartment is clean enough for a new renter or the unit must be professionally cleaned.

We would be happy to discuss this with you.

I can’t say any other apartment managing companies are much better, but Ugroup and Healey place were majorly disappointing.",,,,,"Natalie, we are so sorry that you experienced these inconveniences.
As previously stated, unfortunately, the elevator was not a simple fix. A part of the elevator that needed to be replaced had to be custom made (fabrication itself took 4 weeks) resulting in longer downtime than we could have predicted. We wanted to make sure the elevator was completely safe and functional before it was used by the public again. The safety of our tenants is our number one priority. We are happy to report that the new part was installed and the elevator at Healey Place was returned to a safe, fully functional status as of around 9am this morning (August 3rd).
As for the cockroach issue, that's awful and we're so sorry that you experienced that, Natalie. We would like to hear more information so we can make sure this issue is resolved.
We would love to speak with you to understand what we can do better and for a chance to make this right. Please email us at Leasing@UGroupCU.com or call (217) 352-3182. We look forward to talking with you.

My interactions with the front office have been fairly limited, but they’ve been positive. In my experience they are really responsive to emails and accommodating to most concerns.
The maintenance team is easily the best I’ve ever experienced. They are very quick, usually making repairs the same day. The repairs have also been really thorough and better than you might expect. Most recently, a squeaky ceiling fan was replaced with a new model that looks great and runs whisper quiet. At my previous building, a caretaker lived on site. He did a fantastic job of making the space look great and clean, and quickly responding to repair and upkeep issues.
The unit I live in looks great, but I do wish the same level of upkeep were given to the building. The halls have old carpet and the staircases are exposed concrete with stains from spills over the years. It’s not the biggest issue, but it doesn’t give a great first impression to guests. A numerical keyless entry system was disabled about a year after moving into the building.

Meg lacks social skills and is very unprofessional and condescending. Someone in the reviews mentioned how she “had robotic responses” and I completely agree with that statement.

Be prepared to have half or more of your security deposit withheld for: “carpet cleaning, painting and cleaning”; what most lessors consider as normal wear and tear. *As we did live there for almost 3 years. It wouldn’t matter if you hired professionals to remodel the unit you rented before you moved out, you still wouldn’t receive your deposit back. I’m being sarcastic to make the point that you will never receive your full deposit back.

I received an email from Meg to see if it was okay to show the property to potential renters, which I was currently renting, DURING A WORLDWIDE PANDEMIC. However, I didn’t receive a courteous email about move out procedures. As Meg stated, “Move out procedures can be found on the website.”

The University group does not build relationships with their tenants. Tenants are strictly seen as business opportunities. I can tell they rent to a lot of college students as I received emails about leaving the temperature set to 62 degrees when not in the apartment. Theses emails didn’t apply to me as me and my family lived in their properties off campus.
A simple check-in/ anniversary email would have been nice to receive.

I WOULD NOT recommend anyone to rent from the University Group, EVER! This was my first and last time leasing from a company.

1. Our apartment was very dirty and only half painted when we moved in.  Our bathtub was pink, the kitchen floor was sticky and there was an inch of dust in the closets. Oh and by the way, we paid a $200 cleaning fee BEFORE moving in.

2. Moving out early ended up costing us much more than if we had just moved out and didn't turn in our keys. Apparently, someone came into our apartment a month after we moved out, set the ac to 62 degrees, turned the oven on, and opened up every faucet. We had to pay for 8,000 gallons of water and 4,000 kWh we didn't use. We literally paid more in utilities for the 3 months we weren't living there than the previous 8 months.

(See recent reviews about the elevator being broken). I live on the top floor and have been moving everything up and down the stairs alone. As someone who isn’t that strong, I have dropped things, sprained my ankle, and literally walked up over 100 flights of stairs over the past few days to move my stuff. The leasing office responded to a review that the elevator would be fixed by the move out date of August 3rd. Well, it’s August 3rd and the elevator is STILL not fixed. I do not recommend living at a University Group property. They are untrustworthy and clearly do not care about their residents. I have called several times about the elevator with my frustrations and never once did they offer any type of reparations or extensions for me to move my things out.",,,,,"QQ, it makes us sad to hear about your expereince with the elevator issue. We can certainly understand how frustrating it must have been to use the stairs to move all of your things.
As previously stated, unfortunately, the elevator was not a simple fix. A part of the elevator that needed to be replaced had to be custom made (fabrication itself took 4 weeks) resulting in longer downtime than we could have predicted. We wanted to make sure the elevator was completely safe and functional before it was used by the public again. The safety of our tenants is our number one priority. We are happy to report that the new part was installed and the elevator at Healey Place was returned to a safe, fully functional status as of around 9am this morning (August 3rd).
Once again, we are so sorry for the many inconveniences you've had to experience with the elevator being out of operation. Could you reach out to us one more time? We would love to speak with you for a chance to make this right. Please email us at Leasing@UGroupCU.com or call (217) 352-3182. We look forward to hearing from you, QQ.

After five days submitting the request, he came in with ""So your dryer is not working AGAIN?"" And would not listen to me but kept saying ""I have 20 years of experience working on dryers."" ""It is very normal for a dryer to run two cycles to get the clothes dry.""

To be fair, the apartments are very nice but the elevator issue has been ridiculous. The elevator at our apartment complex has been broken for over a month. OVER A MONTH. I’ve had to walk up 7 flights of stairs from my car to my apartment every single day. That itself is annoying but the worst part is there are 5 days until my lease ends and the elevator still isn’t fixed. If this elevator isn’t fixed within the next day or two, I don’t know how I’m going to move all of my stuff out and down 7 flights of stairs. It’s been a stress not for me, but plenty of other residents in the complex.

I understand there needing to be time for repair but this has been egregiously long. They emailed us saying it would be fixed this week, but yet it is not. This whole elevator issue ruins any good aspects of the Healey Place or University Group.",,,,,"Noah, we are very sorry to hear that the elevator issue at Healey Place has been so challenging. I'm sure it has been frustrating to have to use the stairs for a month. Unfortunately, it is not a simple fix and we want to make sure the elevator is completely safe and functional before it's used by the public again. We are working tirelessly to have the elevator fixed well before your move-out date coming up on August 3!
Once again, we're so sorry for all of the inconveniences you've had to experience with the elevator being down. We would love to speak with you for a chance to make this right. Please email maintenance at Maintenance@UGroupCU.com or call (217) 352-1472. We look forward to hearing from you regarding this.

It is rather unfortunate that the overgenerous Google rating system doesn't allow for negative stars. Renting from these people can become a nightmare of biblical proportions. AVOID. Many reviews mention the shady practice of offering tenants a dirty apartment when moving in, while still charging hundreds upon hundreds of dollars worth of the ""cleaning"" they never do, upon moving out. They've been called on it innumerable times, but they continue this banana republic, corrupt practice. They even respond to reviews with great ""innocence"" but recidivate over and over and over again. Greed, dishonesty, incompetence, and shamelessness are just the polite ones among the attributes which define ""university group"". If you don't value your health, by all means go ahead and rent. If there are 5 degrees out there and your heating breaks, or if there are 100 degrees and the AC fails, they will do NOTHING for many long days, not to mention the insolent, callous, crude attitude of the employees, when you ""dare"" to complain.

On rare occasions, our system charges incorrectly. If you do not have carpet then you will receive a refund for that charge. Please email us at the email below if you do not receive that in the coming weeks.
We have a high standard for the cleanliness of our apartment units. The units must be cleaned according to the move-out procedures on our website: https://ugroupcu.com/move-in-move-out/
Once again, we are sorry that the charges were unexpected.
Our team aims to serve our tenants with a high standard of excellence.
Could you reach out to us one more time?
We would love to speak with you for a chance to make this right. Please email us at Account.Inquiries@UGroupCU.com. We look forward to hearing from you, Kevin.

We made the mistake of continuing the lease with UGroup. They've done it again. Scammed $400 from our security deposit. The reason is ""cleaning"". Literally the bill attached to our security deposit check had ""cleaning - $408.25"" and NO explanation. I called them for an explanation and they haven't gotten back to me for a month now! Avoid leasing with Ugroup if you can! They love scamming.

Edit (2017):

I got part of the deposit back. It took sometime, but they got back to me because they wanted me to take down this review.

Original post:

Maintenance response is good. But they scam the deposit and when asked about it they said there is a huge wait to meet with the managers to talk about it, which just confirms that there are lot of victims here.

When in reality, I called my management company to get an escalation on a work order that has not been completed to date.  And then Beverly decided to hang up on me.

When I called back Beverly picked up the phone and I informed her that I just called in relation to a work order and she hung up on me.  Beverly responded with, ""I didn't hang up on you, I transferred you.""  I basically went back and forth with Beverly as if I were a child in grade school about the fact that earlier she told me that I had to call the Maintenance number, she responded with you do.  I personally, do not know how someone so trite and just plain ignorant who has zero to no customers service skills whatsoever could be given the responsibility to pick up the phone and represent a company that is reliant on the appreciation of customers.  Not only did Beverly not provide me with adequate customer support but even if she were to hint a smidge of frustration over my end in relation to my outstanding work order to not take my name, unit, and phone number to try to escalate the issue that has been an issue for so long but to just hang up on me, and may I add prior to actually even providing me with the maintenance phone number is by far one of the worst forms of customer support I have ever had the experience of enduring.  Not only that but to be a representative of an industry that is reliant on customers informing them of property conditions and to be non-shalant about a property issue and doesnt do anything to assist in preserving  property is unfair to customers who reside in properties.",,,,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwbU11MVR3EAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x7081e12f4c1e30f5!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIC0mMu1Tw%7CCgwIs_bv6wUQoM_Z1wE%7C?hl=en-US,1,1568406323,09/13/2019 20:25:23,12,8107008397500362997,200,17,10,38,399

Yup, it's working, but with abnormal noise which is loud that all visitors can hear and say 'it's really annoying' :(

If you want to live in University Group apartment, you might have to endure some inconvenience or uncomfortable atmosphere, or maybe somehow dangerous environment to your health, in your unit. They might not response to your request and say ""We have nothing to do with that""

---------------
Regarding the response posted on 3/15/2021 by the University Group,

I've already requested 3 times and called 2 times for this issue and the University Group rejected the second look. All I got from the University group was ""We don’t replace appliances that are in normal working order. Just because it may be an older model doesn’t mean it gets replaced if it’s working as it should"".

The point is, I'm not saying the device is ""old"". The device creates ""NOISE"" that one of technicians from the University Group can't hear. The device (refrigerator) is 21 years old, but not all 20-year-old refrigerators have this kind of sound. All my friends were surprised for the fact that there exists a technician who says ""It's a normal sound"" after hearing such ""NOISE"". In common sense, a device operating with an abnormal ""NOISE"" should be fixed.

FYI: According to the United States Department of Energy, refrigerators last approximately 12 years. At that point, it's likely time to replace it.

I just want to inform the condition of appliances of the University Group and the maintenance service quality to future customers.",,,,,"Jun, this is never what we want to hear. Please come see us at the office, email us at leasing@ugroupcu.com, or call (217) 352-3182 and we'd welcome the chance to take a second look at what's going on here.

We are sorry that these charges were unexpected.

However, we have a high standard for the cleanliness of our apartment units. The units must be cleaned according to the move-out procedures on our website: https://ugroupcu.com/move-in-move-out/
Those move-out procedures are the same steps that we take to make sure the apartment is clean enough for a new renter or it must be cleaned.

We would love to speak with you about this to see how we might improve.

We would be happy to resend the offer to you.

Once again, we are so sorry for the furniture delays.
Our furniture providers have been extremely backordered due to COVID-19 which is, unfortunately, out of our control.

On rare occasions, our system charges incorrectly. If you do not have carpet then you will receive a refund for that charge. Please email us at the email below if you do not receive that in the coming weeks.

As for any other charges, we have a high standard for the cleanliness of our apartment units. The units must be cleaned according to the move-out procedures on our website: https://ugroupcu.com/move-in-move-out/
These procedures are the same steps that we go through to make sure the apartment is clean enough for a new renter or it must be professionally cleaned before the next tenant moves in.

Please let us know if you do not receive your carpet cleaning refund!

It’s super close to all my classes, and within walking distance of 90% of the places I go. The proximity to Target is very convenient for a grocery trip after class, and anything else you might need. The amenities have got to be my second favorite thing about the Dean. The study room is really nice, and it’s very convenient since I can head up to my apartment if I need anything in the middle of my study session. The gym and separate yoga room is also really useful. One of the biggest downsides of the Dean is that the in-unit washer-dryer is located directly in the kitchen and living area, and the washer is VERY loud, so I try to be in my room when someone’s doing laundry. Also, if you have a car, beware of the insanely tight turns when entering the parking garage. It’s very easy to scrape the side of your car since it’s very narrow. Other than that, the experience at the Dean has been very pleasant, and the biggest reason I would pick the Dean is the location.",,,,,"Devanshi, thank you for sharing all the things you love about our community!

One of the front desk staff is unfriendly but I believe she was removed by the manager.
Also the price goes up dramatically after i move out. The small m1 studio was 1199 and with discount when I live in but know it's 1699...the 1b is 2000 which is amazingly a Chicago downtown style....cannot believe anyone spent over 1200 a month living in this remote university town, that's unbelievable.

They said they sent the check, but after 20 days, I still didn't receive it. So I asked if they can send another check, they said they will check with the accounting department if they can do so. Then 12 days passed, I sent three follow-ups, but no one replied. Really frustrating. Their response rate is roughly 50%, and wait time is on average more than 4 days. I remember they were much more efficient when they respond to inquiries on leasing apartments. It has been more than two months and the issue is still not resolved.

Original review:
Lived there last year. It's been two months since my move-out and I haven't received my deposit refund check. Contacted them three times through email but no one responded.",,,,,"Bing-Yuan, thank you for contacting us. We know the importance of responsive communication and apologize if there have been any misunderstandings regarding your deposit. Unfortunately, when we requested the refund to be reissued a while back, there were some issues with the mailing service. We have requested for it to be overnighted.

First off, the parking garage is stupidly designed - they must have met the legal minimum size to be able to allow cars to enter - the side of every other car in the garage is scraped due to their stupid design! Second of all, the management is TERRIBLE. Among the worst I have seen in Champaign. When asking the management about certain things, you are often be met with the answer ""There's nothing I can do"" or ""Let me write down your name"" - and absolutely NOTHING is done in regards to your issue. Second of all, the wifi is terrible. I have a friend who had a remote proctored exam today and was FAILED because the wifi went down mid-test and remained down for the remainder of the day. Now he has to go through the process of appealing his test grade and there's a chance his graduation schedule may be hindered! When he called the building to ask if the wifi could be fixed earlier in the day he was met with the answer ""There's nothing I can do"". Not to mention the fact that they drastically spike up their rent prices every year so renewing isn't feasible, the elevators often take too long to come, and the building just manages to ""lose"" your packages. When asking the front desk staff what happened to your package they will often times simply say ""contact the seller and have them send you another one"".

Since, I have moved in, rent has increased, but I do not think that is uncommon for apartments in Champaign and Urbana; inflation is real. However, if you have the money to spend (some of the 3 and 4 bedrooms are not too much more money than other places) I definitely recommend the HUB. Parking is very expensive, so that is something else to consider. The amenities are incredible; I love the gym and it’s nice to have access to the rooftop pool.

Living in an apartment complex with excellent amenities can greatly enhance your quality of life. The terrace provides a beautiful outdoor space to relax and enjoy fresh air, while the pool offers a refreshing place to cool off during the hot summer months. Having access to a beautiful clubroom provides a great space for entertaining guests or hosting events. It can also be a place to socialize and meet new people within the complex.

For those who need a quiet space to study or work, the study spots in the lobby can be a convenient solution. The lobby can also serve as a communal area where residents can relax and chat with neighbors.

The furniture and amenities in the apartment complex can also make a significant difference in your living experience. If the furniture is comfortable and stylish, it can make your apartment feel like a home. Large windows can provide plenty of natural light, making your space feel bright and inviting. Additionally, amenities such as a gym and package delivery services can make life more convenient for residents.

One of the most important factors in any apartment complex is the staff. It is important to have friendly and attentive staff who can assist with any issues or concerns that arise. They can provide a sense of security and ensure that the complex is well-maintained and safe for residents.

Overall, living in an apartment complex with excellent amenities and attentive staff can greatly improve your quality of life. It can provide opportunities for relaxation, entertainment, and socialization, while also making daily tasks more convenient. So if you are fortunate enough to live in such a place, be sure to express your gratitude to the staff for their hard work and dedication to creating a comfortable and enjoyable living environment.

While there are many luxury aspects of the apartment such as the lobby area, pool and rooftop areas, I have faced many problems with maintenance areas. For example, we were provided with an oven that had malfunctioned in an apartment, but was placed in ours and we weren't made aware of potential safety concerns with it until second semester of living here. The stairways and exit hallways are not well kept and are dirty, as well as the outdoor lounge not being cleaned which removed some of the pleasant atmosphere of it. Additionally, we had problems with our thermostat and a maintenance guy who came in just told us not to put on the AC because it wasn't working rather than fixing it. Lastly, while I have had a couple positive experiences with staff, my roommates have had rude encounters when having discussions with staff about problems they were having. Another issue is that the layout we were provided with didn't match what we had in our apartment. A couple of things were positive, like 100 sheets of free printing per month and safety with the key fobs. However, for the price I am paying each month the lack of upkeep and issues with maintenance is ridiculous, which is why I am not choosing to live there again next year.",,,,,"Thank you for voicing your concerns.

I have had a few poor experiences in roommate matching, getting an interior room when I paid for one with windows (this was mitigated), and with water pressure sometimes being wonky. Just know that the touring unit is probably not what your unit will look like (we have exposed concrete in our living room and ceilings, making it look unfinished). Guest policy is also a lot shorter than JSM's and they don't give you more fridges/storage space in a 4x4.

The Hub offers a short walk (~10 minutes) to almost every school building you need to get to which is essential for students. Plus, the building goes out of its way to create community-building events for its residents to meet each other and build a sense of comradery which I have not seen anywhere else on UIUC's campus. The apartments are nicely furnished and access to the gym is always available. My only complaint would be that I wish the pool was open more regularly, but that is dependent on the inclement weather we get here in Champaign and not the properties doing at all.

From the breathtaking views to the top-notch amenities, every aspect of life here exudes luxury and convenience.
First and foremost, the view from my apartment is nothing short of spectacular. The floor-to-ceiling windows provide an unobstructed panorama of the city's skyline, while the natural light pouring in creates an airy and welcoming ambiance. Watching the sun rise and set each day has become a personal highlight and a constant reminder of the beauty that surrounds us.

The outdoor pool area is an oasis that instantly transports you to a high-end resort. Surrounded by comfortable lounge chairs, it's the perfect place to relax and soak up some sun after a long day. The pool itself is immaculate, with crystal-clear water that's always at the perfect temperature.

As a fitness enthusiast, I'm particularly impressed with the on-site workout room. Filled with state-of-the-art equipment and plenty of space to move, it rivals any high-end gym I've visited. From cardio machines to free weights, there's something for everyone, regardless of their fitness level. Plus, the floor-to-ceiling mirrors and ambient lighting create an inspiring atmosphere that motivates me to push harder during my workouts.

One of the standout features of this apartment complex is the attentive and professional staff. From the moment I first inquired about living here, they've gone above and beyond to ensure my every need is met. It's clear that the management team takes great pride in providing exceptional service to their residents.

The location of the luxury apartment is another major perk. Nestled in the heart of Champaign, I'm just a stone's throw away from shopping, dining, and entertainment options.

Inside my apartment, the attention to detail is evident in every corner. High-quality fixtures and finishes, such as quartz countertops and stainless steel appliances, create a modern and sophisticated living space. The open floor plan allows for seamless movement between the living and dining areas, while the spacious bedrooms offer ample storage and a restful retreat at the end of the day.

In summary, my experience living at this luxury apartment complex in Champaign has been nothing short of extraordinary. The combination of stunning views, resort-style amenities, and impeccable service has elevated my lifestyle to new heights.",,,,,"We are so pleased to hear that you enjoy living at Hub Champaign Daniel!

Our dishwasher did not work since August move in and it was not fixed until after fall break. Currently, our ice machine has been broken for a few weeks.

Another leasing team member later took the responsibility and helped me solve the issue. Special thanks to the diligent and exceptional work of Whitney, who really cares how residents feel.

-----------------------------------------

When I was in the process of selecting a unit, I was recommended for my current one with what was described as ""premium features"", notably including big windows. I was also shown a model room (regular one) in which the window was openable, which is important to me as I care about air freshness and humidity.

However, upon moving into the actual unit, I discovered that all the big windows in my unit are not openable, thereby depriving me of any natural air flow.

This detail was never communicated to me by the leasing team beforehand, and the misrepresentation in the model room further misled me in my decision-making process. If I had been made aware of this, I would have certainly opted for a different unit.

Moreover, I find it objectionable that I am charged an additional fee for this the big window as ""premium feature"" – about an extra $20 per month.

While I would like to believe that this omission of information was not intentional, unfortunately, it does give the impression of dishonesty.

More sadly, when I approached the assistant manager of the building seeking a resolution or potential compensation for this issue, I felt she was being impatient and trying to brush me off without a real discussion or any meaningful effort to address the situation by just stating there’s nothing she could do as there’s no such policy.",,,,,"We appreciate your detailed feedback and apologize for the inconvenience you've faced regarding the windows in your unit. We understand your frustration and acknowledge that our communication could have been clearer in this regard.

We genuinely strive to provide accurate information during the selection process.

We did our best to fulfill your preferences based on your description, and we understand that we fell short in meeting your expectations in this specific aspect.

My friends and I started the apartment search pretty late in the game and were concerned that we wouldn't be able to find an apartment that we loved. However, what I appreciated about CC is that management here is super friendly, helpful, and accommodating in getting us housed for next year.

Of course, CC isn't the only apartment with competitive features. However, here are some features that really won our hearts:

- Fantastic Amenities: 20 study rooms with screens and open tables? This is a student's dream, and as a telecommuter, I'm even more impressed with how every floor has a handful of conference rooms for group or individual studying. The clubhouse, gym, etc. are really nice, but the sheer number of conference rooms far exceeded any that we saw in other apartment complexes.

- Location, Location, Location: Proximity to the Engineering library on campus is key. You can bike, bus, or walk to campus in a matter of minutes.

- Super responsive management: Shout out to ZACH! Every email, phone call, question, etc. was fielded promptly and with a friendly willingness to help. Zach even stayed after hours to help clear up any of myriad of questions and get through the application/lease signing process. I saw other residents pop in and out of the leasing office for random requests, and there were always a handful of staff that jumped on to help them.

- Diversity & Community: It's no big secret that UIUC hosts a rich demographic of students from various backgrounds. It feels friendly, community-like, and safe and I see really cute decorations hung up around people's doors celebrating their cultural background. Every resident I've run into has been nice, and I see various people walking their dogs around. It feels like a nice dorm experience but with an upscale swing.

- Parking: CC has way more affordable parking than other vendors out there. And during the winter when it snows, you'll want covered parking if you own a car.

- Layouts: The units that we visited (and I visited friends' non-model units as well for a ""real look"") were pretty clean and comparable to the ones we saw online through pictures. I like the kitchen island space since I do plan on cooking a lot, but the furnishings are convenient if you don't want to move in/out a lot of items.

I can't speak much for the roommate selection process since I'm moving in with friends I already know, but each one of the rooms can lock according to a keyfob so it seems to be reasonably safe & private if that's your thing.

It is just a feedback to management. My friend is already second year with CC (Campus Circle), and this her last year. She told me that CC does a very nice treats for residents like free massage or desserts and etc. Unfortunately, she said that they only give it to first top 10 residents who signed up. The issue is, CC never been transparent with their selections. They never inform who were the winners and even if they selected the winners. So it seems like they have favorite people to select among all list or even not giving these type of rewards at all. It is a minor thing since CC does not even have to do it, but if they organize such days with treats where people have to sign up, they have to be transparent and show how they selected and etc. Like any lottery in the world. So it does not matter for her since she is leaving, but it would be nice for the future residents. Decided to leave it here. Sending my much love to everyone at CC.",,,,,"Thank you for taking the time to provide us with your feedback. We understand your frustration regarding the transparency of our selection process for events like free massages or desserts. We apologize for any confusion caused.

We'd like to clarify that we typically organize these treats for a few select events, particularly during summer hours when there are fewer residents present. We do understand the importance of transparency, and while we may not explicitly announce the winners to everyone, we often post the names of the winners on our social media platforms, specifically on our Instagram page (@campuscircleurbana). We encourage you to check out our social media for updates and announcements regarding these events.

We appreciate your input and will take it into consideration as we strive to improve our communication and make these events more inclusive and transparent for future residents.

I want to extend my deepest empathy for the experiences you've had with the recent incidents in our parking garage and bike storage room. It's truly disheartening to hear about the difficulties you've faced and I understand your concern.

Upon thorough investigation, we discovered your car was parked in an area where towing is enforced due to unauthorized parking.  Additionally, your vehicle was not registered in our system, making it challenging for us to promptly reach out to you. This combination of factors resulted in your car being towed.

I want to assure you that your concerns are of the utmost importance to us.  We are taking decisive action to enhance patrol measures throughout our building. This includes implementing an overnight security guard.
Please know we deeply value you as a resident.  If there is anything else we can do to assist you or if you have any further concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to us. We are here to listen, support, and address your needs to ensure you have a 5 star living experience in our community.

The people who helped us sign the lease no longer work there, and it's not worth my initial review.

When we moved in, the place was disgusting. They charged us three weeks of rent for cleaning and preparing the place before we were allowed to move in. But clearly they didn't clean the place. There was red stuff in the dishwasher, dirt and trash, dust CAKED onto the floors... We called maintenance asking for help, and the guy said incredulously, ""I don't have a mop.""

Well, fast forward to us scrubbing the place down, putting up with it for a year, and moving out.... I just got a notice from a debt collector 5 months after I moved out that I owe them additional post-moving cleaning fees?? The fees don't make sense, and it's frustrating, given our bad move in experience. I tried to call them and they said there's nothing they can do about these fees now that it's gone to a debt collector.

Live somewhere else that's cheaper and with better management!",,,,,"Hi Mackenzie,

This modern, well-designed community offers a perfect combination of convenience, luxury, and top-notch amenities that cater to students and young professionals alike.

Location: Campus Circle is ideally situated within walking distance to the university campus, making it a breeze to get to classes, events, and study sessions. The surrounding neighborhood is vibrant, filled with various shops, eateries, and entertainment options that make it easy to enjoy a balanced lifestyle.

Apartment Features: The apartments themselves are spacious, with contemporary design elements and high-quality fixtures. The full-sized kitchen, complete with stainless steel appliances, provided me with everything I needed to prepare my meals. In-unit washer and dryer were a lifesaver during busy weeks, and the abundant storage space made organization a breeze.

Amenities: Campus Circle truly shines with its amazing amenities. The 24-hour fitness center is well-equipped, clean, and allowed me to maintain my workout routine without any hassle. The study rooms and computer lab were perfect for focused work sessions, while the resort-style pool, outdoor grilling areas, and clubhouse provided opportunities to relax and socialize.

Staff & Management: The staff at Campus Circle are professional, friendly, and always eager to help. They made the move-in process seamless and were prompt in addressing any maintenance requests or concerns. The management also organized regular community events, fostering a sense of camaraderie among the residents.

Safety: The security measures in place, such as controlled access gates and well-lit common areas, made me feel secure throughout my stay. The presence of surveillance cameras and attentive staff contributed to an overall sense of safety.

Weekly Events: One of the highlights of living at Campus Circle Apartments was the fantastic weekly events organized by the management team. Sushi Night and Taco Night were delicious and fun ways to unwind with fellow residents, offering a delightful opportunity to sample different cuisines and bond over a shared love of food. The Easter Egg Hunt added a festive touch to the spring season, bringing joy to residents of all ages. The Earth Day Dirt Cups event was a delightful and eco-conscious celebration that not only satisfied our sweet cravings but also promoted environmental awareness. These events truly enhanced the living experience at Campus Circle, fostering a warm and friendly community atmosphere where it's easy to make lasting connections.",,,,,"Wow!

They charge residents for things that they do not provide adequate services for.

The key fobs to access the elevators, lobby, garage, amenities, staircases, etc. were broken for FOUR months. Directly meaning complete strangers were free to roam the halls, use the parking garage, and use any of the amenities for months on end. Management blamed their contractor and also stated they “contacted their vendor” every time I inquired about it.

The parking garage gates have broken several times even within the first month I lived there. Eventually, management just stopped getting it repaired and it was nonfunctional for several months following. Staff blamed it on “delivery drivers” but that does not make much sense at all considering the mail room/lobby is in the front of the building. There are absolutely no mirrors in the parking garage either. I have almost gotten into multiple head-on collisions.

I moved to Campus Circle in August 2021 and the pool was never opened that summer. Apparently it was closed because they were “changing it to salt water”. June of 2022 I asked again why the pool will not be opening this summer and I was told that they were again “contacting their vendors”. Seriously? ‘Heated Pool’ what a JOKE.

During my lease period, my roommate tested positive for covid and I was in quarantine. She contacted the office several times with calls and emails disclosing to staff that she had tested positive. Thursday came and they were checking on the fire alarm systems throughout the building, maintenance enters anyways. We told staff AGAIN, while they were in our apartment, that we have covid. The following day there were quarterly inspections of the fourth floor units and they entered the apartment yet AGAIN. The whole experience was unprofessional to say the least.",,,,,"Torie, 

Our records show you moved out in July of 2022. We discussed your concerns with you and in response to your other reviews. We're sorry to hear you didn’t have a great experience with Campus Circle. We rectified all of the issues as quickly as possible given external complications not unique to our building.

Regarding amenities, unfortunately, we do need to rely on vendors for some services and we do apologize for taking longer to open as certain parts were needed to get things up and running again.  Our lock system has been fully operational for over a year now as well as the parking garage gates.

The delivery drivers our staff member referred to were the food delivery drivers, not packages. We continuously and repeatedly remind residents to meet with their drivers and not have them enter the parking garage. The annual fire alarm inspection is required by the City of Urbana for your safety and the safety of others in the building. We can assure you we do not want to put our staff at risk, which is why we told your roommate we could listen to her alarm system from outside of her bedroom door, and not enter her room. She was more than understanding of this. 

We will certainly take into consideration adding mirrors to the parking garage as we take resident suggestions very seriously. Thank you for your recommendation.

We are sorry to hear you feel your experience was not top notch. Our staff works hard to provide a clean and comfortable environment for our residents and community.

We also provided reminders about charges associated with late move out if one should occur.  If you could , please reach out to the leasing office as we would be glad to discuss any charges you are concerned about and we will provide clarity about them.  Thank you so much.

Note when looking into this place that they only want to impress you to sign your lease, after that, they fall short on promises and provide limited services. For example, the pool was a large selling point that made the hike to campus worth it and was something the leasing manager sold to us during our tour. I come to find out, 3 days after moving in, that the pool will not be available until next summer and I had to ask someone to receive this information.  Additionally, TV's in the amenity rooms don't work. The room is nice I do like it, however I can get even nicer rooms at the same price closer to campus. To be fair, all of the workers I have come into contact with are very nice and helpful where they can be. However, the fact that they sold us the pool when it may never be available, this apartment is in way too poor of a location to justify the price. Please do not sign here, you will be severely disappointed.
Edit:  The pool will not be ready this fall. This shows perfectly how they lie to look better than they are. They ""contact vendors"" then have no urgency at all and wait for when the vendors feel like it. The doors aren't even locked at this apartment. If someone wanted to waltz into the amenity area uninvited they could easily do so.",,,,,"Hi Chris, Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback on your stay thus far. We appreciate having an opportunity to improve your experience.  We’re glad to hear you’ve had a positive experience with our team and your room. Our pool will be opened this fall 2021 once our vendor changes our equipment from chlorine to salt-water and the pool is inspected by the department of public health for reopening. We are currently in the process of getting a new vendor in and getting the pool up and running.  The package pick up delay is atypical for the year. At the start of the school year people are purchasing additional items for their new homes, and school. This could easily mean 5 packages per person and we have 524 residents in our community.

DO NOT LIVE HERE!!! If you have animals, they will charge you 2500+ when you move out! They do inspections 4 times a year. When they do the inspection, they will break into your room, open your closet, with their shoes on. NO PRIVACY AND BRING THE DIRTS IN!

REPLY: I never had 5 pets, there was once when my friend visited me and she brounght her cats. For that case we had an agreement with Campus Circke and I paid the fine as requested. My 2 cats use the litter box properly and never pee outside. I clean my litter box regularly and I use deodorizers. I cleaned up the apartment after I moved out to the best extend. When I left, there was no odor. I also don't believe that the deodorizer doesn't work and you have to renovate the entire apartment and charge us $5,000.",,,,,"Hello Yurui, The majority of our residents who have cats and dogs receive most or all of their full deposit back. Of the 5 cats in the apartment, 3 were not approved and considered illegal pets. They urinated all over the furniture, carpets, and vinyl flooring. There was pet hair, dander, and litter caked into several areas of your apartment and with having multiple litter boxes, there was a lingering odor that remained after your move-out that was experienced by not only our staff, but by all 3 vendors.To ensure the enjoyment of the apartment for the next resident, we could not in good faith keep the apartment as it was returned. Your usage of the space required a full replace of your flooring due to the urine and claw marks (damage) from your multiple pets.We do not enjoy charging our residents as this doesn't make anyone happy and we understand the basis of our business is its people. This not only adds work for the resident, but for our maintenance team, and vendors, prolonging the time it takes to prepare the apartment for the next person. All exact receipts for the vendors and repairs were provided within a week of closing your account justifying all charges associated.We do provide a notice of entry at least 24 hours in advance to complete quarterly inspections to replace the air filter. This is not considered breaking in as we have provided ample communication, knock and announce ourselves three times before entry, and nothing is in fact broken by our team.  Quarterly inspections are also explained in the move-in packet everyone received physically and digitally. The purpose and expectations are clearly laid out in our communication to our residents.  We are pro-active and are responsible for protecting and maintaining the building for your enjoyment and all other residents.  We follow OSHA requirements and while we cannot remove our shoes we do wear slippers to cover our shoes for those that request it.

Management blamed it on a delivery driver, but that doesn't excuse it happening so many times and it doesn't excuse poorly designed gates (you can easily drive in after a resident who has a gate tag, and then be trapped in the garage with no way to open the gate and no clear signage for delivery drivers that the gates operate by tag only). Management has ""contacted their vendor,"" but that was months ago and there's been no update.

The key fob entry for the exterior building doors doesn't work anymore, leaving most exterior doors fully unlocked. Happened around the same time as the garage gates, and management gave the same answer. ""We've contacted out vendor."" Either their vendor is incredibly slow or they never did contact them, because the doors still don't work.

The key fob entry for my unit stopped working, meaning I couldn't lock the door from the outside. And for some reason the doors don't have physical keys for redundancy. It took several maintenance requests, emails, and calls for us to finally get it fixed so we could lock our door when we go to class. Campus Circle may claim that holiday hours were to blame for the delay, but on the day they were supposed to be fully open we still could barely get a hold of the office. And also, shouldn't they have some manager on hand for emergencies like this? Especially considering that the exterior doors STILL don't lock anyone off the street could have walked into my apartment when I was gone.

Not to mention the other issues mentioned in these reviews. The pool hasn't been open since I got here. The package pickup is slow at best so I just order my packages to amazon lockers. There's been a spilled pint of ice cream hidden behind a hallway door since October that custodial staff hasn't cleaned. They advertise internet and cable, but the internet is a single public network (so I just set up my own router anyway) and the cable signal looks absolutely garbage. The parking garage is so narrow and has blind turns, which is made worse by a lack of mirrors and center lines, resulting in near head on collisions every week.

They'll certainly have excuses related to their vendors, other residents, and delivery drivers. But the fact of the matter is that the building and its facilities are poorly thought out and poorly maintained. If it weren't for the rent concession I got for signing early this year, I could easily get better for cheaper.

At least the front desk staff are all nice.",,,,,"Hi Tobias,We appreciate you leaving your honest feedback.

Well, the story changed. Just picked up the key and found that the unit was changed to another without being informed. A unit facing south was the key reason my roommate and I chose to sign the lease and it was firmly confirmed in the communication and in the document. Having leasee pay $1400+ to secure the lease and secretly changed the unit is the most ridiculous action that I have ever experienced for a lease. Will never lease again.

New building and all kinds of fancy facilities. What bugged me is the property management company, Peak Campus. It’s just uneasy to live with them. For example, they have their “quarterly inspection” and would enter your room without asking whether you allow that or not, even if you’re sleeping, simply because they “have no time” for that. And for the lock down, I don’t think the gym is now open despite other apartments being able to do that month ago. There’s no refund for that, of course. Whole-building fire alarm triggered 4-5 times at midnight before they finally found out who did it. If you constantly complain that there are way too many residents to handle (thus there’s no way to be a little bit more considerate), please just hire more staff!
==========
There were some glitches at the time of signing but they were well resolved later. You may need to ask the manager (instead of receptionists) if you're unclear about some specific terms. Hopefully I will spend a good year here.
==========
I’m still feeling that they don’t know how to best leverage customers’ time. For example, I was asked to sign some documents for about 4-5 times (spanning several months), with one reason being “there are some typos in the document”. I’ve also been to their office a couple of times for these document related things. Anyway, get ready to be bugged by them from time to time!",,,,,"Hi Wenyu,   Thank you for sharing your feedback.

We aim to provide a positive experience for each resident and their guests and are sorry to see you did not enjoy living with us. Thank you for providing insight on how we may improve.  We are sorry you didn’t want to register your vehicle with our office. It was made aware to us that guests could not find a parking space because there were a few cars consistently parked in 4 hour guest parking; moving from space to space and as a result many residents were frustrated their guests could not find a space due to consistent violators. After looking into this issue further, we noticed you had been relocating your vehicle every 4 hours. This is not how our 4 hour parking was intended to be used. We provided a warning notice on your vehicle prior to towing as well as a phone call. Once you noted your vehicle had been towed, you acknowledged to Campus Circle staff you saw the notice and continued moving from space to space in our 4 hour parking.    Each resident is provided with a map of our parking and the policies on move-in day as a reference should they need it in the future. This includes the 4 Hour Parking highlighted as ""Guest Parking"". While we understand residents like to temporarily park in these spaces to unload groceries or grab something from their apartment, this takes away from other residents whose guests are visiting. This parking is very limited and residents who’ve registered for our attached garage parking should use their spaces so guests can enjoy the 4 hour parking.  In regards to your friend, we are more than happy to talk to him individually. Our goal is to provide excellent customer service and ensure each person is enjoying their stay. Please understand it is not in our best interest to blindly assess fines. Each fine has an image to support the charge and we always provide an opportunity for residents to remedy small damages. We are disappointed when residents do not respond to our e-mails or phone calls as we do reach out in hopes to work together to find solutions.   Each inspection we have performed has been prefaced with an e-mail and flyer on the unit door providing advance notice for entry. We also knock and announce ourselves before entering units and bed spaces. We have tried arranging a time to discuss this further in person but have been unsuccessful. If you would like to meet with us, Skype, FaceTime, or WeChat, we’d be more than happy to walk through each item of concern at your earliest convenience.

We are sorry to hear you did not have a good experience. In the beginning of all of our lease signings, we highly encourage each applicant to thoroughly read through the document before signing.  This statement is also bolded on the front of all Lease Contracts. We sit down with each applicant and will answer any question they may have while reading through their documents.  Depending on the circumstance, online payments may not be available. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this may have caused. Please note the re-let fee you paid was 85% of one month’s rent because we found the person to take over your lease. Should you have found the person to take over your lease the fee would have been $300.00. We have records of responding to your e-mails and are sorry you did not receive them.

The mattress had red stain, furnitures were slightly damaged and dirty, some lights didnt work, construction are going on in the main gate so the noise is terrible.

Also, the staff customer service is not great. I referred my roommate after seeing a flyer that said I would receive 300 dollar gift card. However, when I asked for 300 dollar gift card, they said I don’t qualify for the deal because my roommate signed earlier than when the deal was supposed to be in effect.

We are sorry to hear you feel you have not had an ideal experience with move-in. I personally addressed your concerns immediately after you contacted our office during move-in and was able to alleviate your concerns by vacuuming your floor and wiping down your mattress. We also put in service requests regarding additional maintenance concerns that were addressed by our maintenance team the day the requests were placed. Given the current regulations in the amenities due to COVID-19, residents may not gather in groups larger than 10 as we require everyone in our community to wear masks and be cognizant of social distancing. Last year, however, residents were free to have gatherings and host small events with their peers/friends. Any complaints brought to the attention of our office staff regarding these gatherings have been addressed. We recommend contacting our office directly for any concerns that require the attention of Campus Circle management.We apologize about the construction occurring on University Avenue and how bothersome it can be.  Unfortunately, we have no control over the noise levels or when the construction team is scheduled to work. We recommend to reaching out to the City of Urbana to address any concerns you have regarding the construction.  The construction is not on the property of Campus Circle nor is it associated with us.  We offer many specials and incentives throughout the year, all of which are subject to change. At the time your friend signed, we offered a referral incentive of $100 if you referred someone to our property who signed and moved in. The special changed later in the year, but you signed when it was $100.  You were provided with the $100 gift card for referring your friend to our property and would be more than happy to explain the difference in special further should you feel inclined to contact our office directly.As always, feel free to reach out to our office for any questions at all.Best,Marisa at Campus CircleLeasing Manager",1566829109,08/26/2019 14:18:29,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVeHJlS3FRRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x1423f85ab8fc1bb5!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDUxreKqQE%7CCgsIl4TM_AUQgPT9AQ%7C?hl=en-US,1,1603469847,10/23/2020 16:17:27,5,1451276573477706677,100,6,9,28,407

That was a promotion gift and I was told that I will be given when I moved in which was June, 2016. When I moved in, I also was told that it will be given at least by August since August is the ""Official"" move in date. I did not understand ""The official"" term, because the company apparently promoted the apartment as ""Early move-in available.""

Been almost 4weeks since I have moved out, so I left a memo for general manager that I would like to get updates with the gift cards. Same response and no returning calls as promised.

Your time that you spent on marketing could destroy in just one negative&truthful review. I can say this because I was being patient with you and I only have legal rights to pursue at this point.

First and foremost, we are sorry to hear you feel this way and would like to assure you we take all noise complaints seriously. Whenever a noise complaint is brought to our attention, we take the initiative to reach out to the resident causing the noise. If the noise is bothersome enough or late enough, we also encourage you contact the non-emergency police number if the situation occurs after office hours as well as offer to mediate a discussion between both neighbors. After looking into this matter for you, all of the above listed solutions were offered. We also reached out to your neighbor and were able to confirm that this noise came from a Bluetooth speaker that was accidentally left on when the residents were not home. While we do allow transfers (pending unit availability), in situations like these, it is best to attempt to resolve the issue in question rather than instantly transfer a resident. For issues that are able to be resolved, we would certainly not want any resident to be burdened with moving their items to another unit. We apologize that this information was not delivered clearly and would be more than willing to discuss this matter further should you like to contact our office directly. Sincere regards,Marisa with Campus Circle",1602509963,10/12/2020 13:39:23,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDb183cTJBRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x1423f85ab8fc1bb5!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDCo_7q2AE%7CCgsI6aiC_AUQ6IrXNg%7C?hl=en-US,1,1602262121,10/09/2020 16:48:41,12,1451276573477706677,100,6,9,28,407

There is no way to verify if any of these people actually “visited their friend here once” or  “had their food delivered here accidentally.”

Unfortunately, it’s common for skeevy businesses to hire people to leave reviews like this where they don’t necessarily say they lived here but they leave 5-star reviews for the business doing practically nothing.

So, I’m leaving this review because Campus Circle seems to have some bad business practices. I haven’t lived with them, but I still think they’re a bad business and people should know that.

Since we have renewed with CC and sublease to someone else, we thought things could be different and repeatedly checked with the desk if we were also required turning in our key to the front desk before August. We talked to the officer ,officer asked Molly and we talked to Molly. The only response I received is “No, you don’t have to move out by July 31st, but make sure giving us 24hours for inspection prior to new residents arrival”. With that said, we packed everything in the room and were ready to move them out when fall comes. Unfortunately, at the midnight of August 1st, in another country that’s 10000miles away,we were told that we would have to move everything out within two hours , or they will throw everything away. After several rounds of negotiations , they told us they were sorry for telling me the wrong informations but we do need to move things out and if we need lawful assistant they would be able to help. (What the heck was even that ) Also , they offered to move things out for us at a price of 50bucks per garbage bag or item. Okay. We stayed up all night looking for friends staying in Champaign to move things for us ( and thank god there was one or we probably would lose everything. Eventually we were “ only “charged for 300 bucks:) including 50 bucks for a toilet towel , 50 for a unmoved curtain, another 85 for not returning key in time.

Molly is nice at the time you signed lease, they will also let you leave positive feedback on every social network. But when you start moving in, things will change. They will frequently come in you apartment doing inspection, find something broken, repair it, and bill you (which other property management only does when you move out). It makes sense because they want to charge you more times. They repair and bill me the blinds on 01/31, which is also the day I paid my Feb rent. On 02/01, they sent me the blinds repair bill and then on 02/02, they said my payment is error because it didn’t include the blinds charges. How I can possibly includ blinds repairing fee before they send me the bill? Also, when I sent another check on 02/05 including the blinds fee, it counts as late.

We perform quarterly inspections to replace your air filter for your convenience and enjoyment of the space as well as to keep up our preventative maintenance.  Unfortunately, when we see damages, we do hold resid  ents accountable. Expectations and estimated charges are outlined prior to moving in and we do our best to ensure this is clearly communicated with each resident.  Moving forward we intend to give a bigger window for when you receive the notification for any charge (only if applicable) and when these are due. Should the unit be returned with normal wear and tear, charges will not be assessed again giving you the opportunity to receive your entire deposit back. We want to ensure all future residents moving in will be given the opportunity to move into a unit without damages.  In our conversation regarding rent, it was made clear late fees are assessed on the 4th of the month.

Today they offer me the renew price of 780/month, but I promise to you all that the new signed price will be lower, and they will reduce their price when they realize that they can’t rent out all of the rooms. Last year, after they offer me a renew price of 780/month, and they told me that would be the best price I can get, they offer a price of 699 for new resident in the spring.

We are disappointed to see your friend has not reached out to us to re-evaluate their charge as all residents have the opportunity to fix the issue and schedule a re-inspection. We re-assess the charge if it has been remedied. It is important our residents communicate with us as we cannot fix their issue if we do not know about it. While we do our absolute best to communicate our expectations and policies for the use of the apartment and community, we unfortunately have seen damages that may be repairable resulting in charges to replace the item(s). Estimated charges are given to each resident prior to moving in. We are open to any recommendations on how we may better communicate these policies. We provide notices before entry and notices after quarterly inspections should there be an issue to address. We are always looking for ways to improve the experience of our residents. Please help us help you and your friends. In regards to rates, they are based on a tier system and once we hit the number of spots in each tier, the rate goes up a predetermined amount.  This year we are doing our best to reward renewals who sign early.  We will continue increasing the rate for new leases as more people sign, so it’s better to sign earlier than later.  Let us know if you have any questions.

Renewing the lease is by racing who fill in a google form they sent by email faster.

Unreasonable charges. If they find a tiny stain on the carpet, congratulations, prepare $50 to lose.There are numerous reasons to charge u for any unnoticeable damages, so make these into ur budget when calculating ur living cost.

Countless room inspection. They enter ur room once a month on average. In July, they entered twice for many wired reasons.

The room arrangement shown to u is wrong when signing the lease, but they refuse to correct it and charge $100/person if u want to exchange ur room with ur roomates even if u have not moved in yet. When my suitemates and I were picking our rooms, I chose one far from the washing machine and dryer. On the first day I entered my unit, I found my room was the one that is close to the machines. The manager Molly said the room map is not correct and they refused to take any responsibility. I talked to my suitemate and he agreed to exchange the rooms, but the manager said we had to pay $200 for the exchange even if we had not moved in yet!

The residents are always on the last position on their priority list.",,,,,"Hi Zhaorui, we appreciate your honest feedback so we may improve the experiences for you and our community. We set a high standard for ourselves and are disappointed to hear your experience with us was not a positive one. Would you like to arrange a time to discuss in person or over the phone/Skype call your concerns?  With the high demand for leasing in 2017-2018, we wanted to ensure the leasing process for 2018-2019 was as smooth as possible and gave current residents the opportunity to renew.  We had an overwhelming amount of inquiries about renewing, so we needed a system to keep track of who requested to renew first because we renew on a first come first served basis. People’s responses were time stamped and the difference in pricing was based on when we ran out of a certain rate.  It was true, the earlier you signed the better rate you would have received compared to waiting to sign your renewal lease; our rates were based on a tier system. We urged every resident to sign as soon as possible before the next tier came into effect.  We perform quarterly inspections and preventative maintenance to replace your air filter, to confirm no maintenance is needed, and to avoid pests.  If maintenance is needed, we are required to enter your unit to correct any issue.  With small damages such as carpet stains, we provide each resident an opportunity to correct the issue to avoid a charge.  This process is outlined in the Quarterly Inspections brochure provided in an e-mail to you and is also delivered to your door.  We always welcome residents to communicate with us so we can work together. Please let us know if you did not receive this and we can send it to you again.  When selecting a unit and signing your Exclusive Bed Space Addendum, we do our best to make applicants aware of unit differences. This is also described in your Contract before signing. We are very sorry there was a misunderstanding. We make it a priority to listen to our residents, but not everyone is willing to talk to us.  We hope you consider discussing these items with us further.

Once I accidentally made a payment with an account which did not have enough fund. After I realized that, I made another payment and cleared out all my balance.
However, their system was still charging me repeatedly. Though the system credited back what it charged for, the bank placed a returned item fee on my account once campus circle tried to withdraw money.
I consulted bank workers and they said unless campus circle stopped charging me, the fee would come up again and again.
Then I emailed property manager for help. Clearly there is something wrong with their system and instead of helping me fix this, she gave me a ledger which showed nothing and ask me go figure it out myself.
I was so pissed off. I hope my broken English described this issue clear.
Besides, they raise the rent by whatever they want. I signed a 4B4B last year for 700+/mo and they asked me to renew with a price of around 900/mo. When they realized they cannot rent all rooms out, they repriced 4B4B to 650. Thank god I didn’t renew.

Most importantly, the management likes to stalk whoever posted reviews. I think it's best if they give people some privacy.",,,,,"Hi Sihan,   The employees of Campus Circle and Peak Campus do not retaliate against residents who leave reviews.  If you change your mind and would like to discuss our policies and inspections, feel free to call me, email me, or stop in the office.  We give people multiple chances and opportunities to remedy any issues before a charge is assessed.  Our inspections are important for both the resident and management to ensure we are keeping a well-maintained home for you and your roommates. Prior to entry, we announce ourselves to avoid surprise or disturbance when entering whereby following our e-mail that includes why we are inspecting your space and when. We replace your air filter and confirm that there are no issues that may have not been reported such as water spots on ceilings from lack of shower curtains in the unit above or lint traps that have not been emptied which can make it more difficult for your dryer to dry clothes which uses more energy. We are here to help as these are common issues apartment renters may not be aware of and you are not charged for these things. These are simply checks to make sure we can provide the best quality of living for everyone at Campus Circle.    Charges are only assessed if something has been damaged and needs to be replaced or repaired and require ordering parts or new pieces.  Blinds damaged by pets or a fine associated for smoking in the community are examples as this not only damages the apartment, but affects the surrounding neighbors.   While we do offer individual leases, it is made clear every person in the unit is responsible for the shared common areas. If someone takes responsibility for common area damages, only that person will be charged.   The most recent inspection was crucial as Urbana, Illinois had record breaking low temperatures and we needed to confirm all windows were properly closed to avoid frozen pipes and water damage. We closed windows that were open or not properly locked. The incident you are referring to is for a resident whose window was not shut and had been found cracked upon entry. Due to the -40 degree weather, it was easy for the double pane window to crack. Fortunately, the window was replaced immediately and no one was harmed. We take our residents experiences and comfort very seriously and are prompt in responding to any maintenance needed. Our property was not the only one that experienced cracked windows from the excessive cold for multiple days.    If you or your friend lives here and is experiencing any problem with the internet connection, please notify our Internet Provider as they can best trouble shoot your issue and are available 24/7. They can detect which router is closest to you, refresh a signal, or perform maintenance if needed.   Recycling bins are provided and available on each floor.  For bigger items, we do ask they are placed in the centrally located Recycling Bin. We also have one on the north-side of the building. Boxes left in the hallway are a trip and fire hazard and we want to ensure our community is clean and free of empty boxes and trash.  Lastly, when we see a negative review, we call the resident directly so we can work together to find a solution for any issue they are experiencing. If they do not answer, we do send an e-mail to ensure we are doing everything we can to improve that persons experience. We pride ourselves on customer service and take reviews very seriously.

Before assessing a charge, we confirm with your Move-In Condition Form the item was not listed in addition to reviewing previous inspections and their images.

A balance is also e-mailed to you each month.  Your deposit is used for qualifying to live in our community if you do not choose to use the Self-Qualifying or Guarantor option provided.  It cannot be used for any other reason during the lease term.  We have continuously tried scheduling a time with you to review your blinds together but have been unsuccessful.  We have also offered for you to send us a picture of the existing damage so we may help you but have not received anything.  Please help us so we may help you.

Our quarterly inspections are completed only 4 times during your lease term. It is necessary to replace your air filters and maintain the community. Our intention is not to charge our residents as we understand no one wants to pay additional fees.  We provide every single person who received a notice for damages an opportunity to remedy the issue and we will perform a re-inspection if requested or required.   Unfortunately when checks are mislabeled under the memo line, it is difficult to decipher which accounts the amounts should be applied to. For example, if the payment is for two apartments but is not specified in the memo line, we will apply the check to the account whose name is on the check only. If you have questions about this process, please let us know.

There’s no human decency or care for their residents, they just want your money!",,,,,"Hi Kaila,   We are sorry you felt this way during your stay and are here to listen. Our business thrives on its people and our goal is not to upset our residents as this would not benefit either party. We hold each person equally accountable and it disappoints us when we see our residents are not following the Lease Contract and Rules and Regulations.   Without reaching out to residents and their guarantor, we cannot understand why rent is unpaid or if rent will be paid. We only call the numbers that have been provided to us upon signing and if we are unable to get in contact with one person, we reach out to the other based on what is in our system. It is our responsibility to let both people know of balances due. Sometimes both people do not respond and we have to continue to follow up until we receive a response to confirm we are on track for payment until rent is paid. We do this for all people who have an outstanding balance and not specifically directed to one person.   Common area charges are assessed to each individual in the unit. When a resident takes responsibility for a violation, we are able to reverse this for the other people involved. Regarding the towing of your vehicle, we give each person 1 warning. If they are repeat violators, they no longer receive a warning and are automatically towed because they have been made aware of the parking policies prior. To add, signs are posted clearly in all lots and a parking map is provided upon move-in for reference. We want to ensure residents and their guests have the opportunity to enjoy the assigned parking as there are limited spaces for the entire community. We do enforce rules equally and residents may not see other vehicles towed or charges for violations.  We are sorry you feel this is unresolved despite meeting with you in person yesterday. Please let us know if you have any additional feedback.

I checked everything when I moved in. Honestly, I don’t remember exactly, but I think if one out of six window screens is missing, I would have noticed it. Either the window screen is not there in the first place or someone steals it. Just think about it, why would anyone steal a window screen??? My roommate is graduating and going to California.

We understand our business thrives on its people and we aim to provide an incredible stay for each of our residents.

Prior to assessing charges we review all forms and your charges were not listed on your move-in condition form. An image was also provided to support this charge. The amounts for charges are based fairly and include the amount to replace items, shipping, and labor. An opportunity to sign the Responsibility of Damages form, should an issue be found in the common area, is also provided. If these damages were caused by someone else, we simply need this form signed from the responsible party to re-assess charges. Please let us know if you have any questions about this process.

The intention for our inspections every 3 months is to replace your air filter and ensure there are no missed maintenance needs in your apartment. We want to make certain that you are living in the best environment possible.   Unfortunately, there are times where we come across damage to the items included with your lease and will ask the person responsible to pay for the cost of replacement so we may provide the next resident with a like-new apartment. The cost includes the furniture, labor, and shipping.   When having an animal, there is always a risk for furniture being scratched. This would happen to any material if an animal is using it as a scratching post with their nails. After reviewing your ledger, you were properly charged the amount and it does not total $1,500.  In addition, the cost has been split between you and your roommate.   During our last quarterly inspection, you were not charged anything. We do not double charge for the same item and you were only charged to replace the property your pet damaged once.   Per our conversation, we can re-inspect the desk chair. We always prefer something is repaired rather than replaced as this benefits both you and our maintenance team. Please let us know if you have further questions.

As soon as you brought your concern about the convenience fee initially showing differently during your credit card payment to our attention, we looked into it immediately. As promised, I did consult with my supervisor and placed a Help Desk ticket so this can be investigated. It appears this was an issue with your cookies or cache on the website or your Resident Portal app was not updated. I did communicate this to you as well. This issue could not be replicated and ultimately the correct fee was charged.  We apologize for the confusion.  If you have any other concerns, please feel free to come in and talk with us in the office.  Thank you.

Thanks for taking the time out of your day to leave your feedback. We apologize you feel our rates are too high, but our rates work in a tier system. As soon as a certain tier is full, we move onto the next tier while the rate increases. Due to the extreme increase in leases we have had, the rates have gone up. This is an incentive to sign early and most apartment communities lease this way.  Regarding the reviews, we encourage our residents and prospects to leave their feedback as we are always interested in how we can improve as well as to see what we are doing right. I wasn’t able to find your name in our system, but, if you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to me directly in the office at 217-619-0116.

In our last inspection, there were no issues addressed in your entire unit. On this most recent inspection, we noted continued smoking in your unit, resulting in your fourth smoking violation.   Cigarette odor is extremely difficult to remove as it clings to our furniture in the apartment, the walls and ceilings, and will require our ozone machine to run for long periods of time in the apartment after your move-out. It also bothers other residents who can smell it.  We also use a special paint on the walls and ceiling and hope the carpet will not require replacement because smoke can stick to the carpet and pad underneath.   This is not the first conversation we have had regarding smoking inside the apartment and we provided the opportunity to resolve this issue. We hope this will be the last time we will have to issue a smoking violation so you do not have to pay the fines. Please let us know if you have any questions about this.

I was hesitant about the entire process, but Savannah Meneley and Sydney were so kind and welcoming. They were patient with me as I visited multiple apartments. The fact that Bankier helps you connect with the people who post sublets is extremely helpful as I could not get people who had rented from other companies to respond to my emails. Actually, the person I sublet the place from did not respond initially but with their help he responded right away after they made contact, and they even made suggestions for improving my direct contact due to the other party being across the globe. Savannah has made multiple contacts with me since that day including basically walking me through the initial paperwork process. I figured out that she stayed in the office after hours to help me twice, including her and Sydney staying after hours on the day I initially searched for apartments and the “manager” staying with her on the Saturday that I picked up my keys. Furthermore, every time I had questions she made me incredibly comfortable asking them. Once I decided that I was going to look for an apartment on-campus for the ‘21-‘22 academic year, I couldn’t imagine going to anyone else but Savannah and Bankier. Savannah has gotten the right people to help me when I’ve had any sort of “issue,” such as needing a bed removed. And, I feel safe with their locks and key fab system. It was a no-brainer for me to rent from them for the upcoming academic year. Of course, I was completely satisfied with the support I got when choosing my apartment for next year which is why I decided to write this.",,,,,"Hi Charles, thank you so much for taking the time to leave such a detailed review!

First and foremost, the building and its units are very clean and safe. The entrance to the building and parking lot are well secured. In addition, the furniture provided in units are awesome (especially compared to the apartments of other realities which are at the same price range).
Moreover, The office staff are very friendly and care highly about their tenants' concerns. Whenever I asked them something, they provided us at no time, or they sent their professional maintenance people quickly to resolve the problems.

I went with Bankier because of the better price options, better location, and recommendations from friends. I have not been dissapointed at all! I lived at 406 e green this year, which is located right behind the bankier office, which means that I see the staff a lot more than most residents probably do. Everyone who works there is quick to give a smile and a wave, and always remembers my name, which is a personal touch I don't think you can get anywhere else. I had some trouble this year in which my apartment was leased before I was able to renew it, which was completely my fault since I waited way too long to decide I wanted to stay in my apartment. The people at Bankier were super understanding and sympathetic, and in my opinion went above and beyond trying to work out where I will live next year. I ended up signing a lease at another apartment close by, and couldn't be happier with my service.

When I was viewing units at the start of their leasing season, Keith showed me a unit that was in the process of being remodeled after I shot down everything else he had to offer. Even though it was half painted and didn't even have cabinets yet, I was enamored with the space. Naturally, I had a million questions for Keith, and I was surprised to find that he confidently had answers for most of them.

Things that he didn't have answers for (will it have a garbage disposal? can I get it unfurnished? do you HAVE to paint these gorgeous hardwood beams or can we leave them exposed?), he made some calls and found out. At most places this probably would have been a weeks-long ordeal to get sorted, and Keith got me the info I needed before we even left the unit.

I signed shortly after, and that was about 8 months before the lease started. During that period, Keith never batted an eye when I hit him with off the wall questions directly via email, and was even so kind as to give me some progress shots of the remodel, as well as a handful of images of the finished product. He was very responsive all the way up until move in day.

The move in process was as smooth as any on campus. There were a few items that needed attention in the unit, which was to be expected. I drafted up my maintenance requests, sent them to Keith, and he submitted them on my behalf shortly afterward. He also helped me get moved in early, which made life so much easier. I've been in the new place a few weeks now, and it's really quite nice. My requests have been taken care of, Keith is still as responsive as ever, and has even offered to drop in and help me with some things like wall mounting my TV.

Pro:
Location Location Location!: most of their apts locate in the center of Champaign downtown, which is extremely convenient for students work in lab till late night and need food around.
Payment option: This company accept check/online bank transfer/ credit card to pay rent, which is convenient.
Space: Their room tend to be larger than market average.
Rooms available even if you apply late: Better apts generally runs out pretty quick, Hot apts could get out of space for next two to three years!

Con:
Obsolete building: Most of their building were really old. They do maintenance, but problems still occur frequently. For example, water heater in upper unit exploded and huge amount of water flood my belongings. You will need to take all these losses by yourself without renter's insurance. (generally cost +$100/Mo.) Heating/Cooling cost is high due to lack of Insulation.

Noise: If you live in their old building, then you will hear every single detail of what your neighbor does. Such as they fart in toilet, close the door, make Love, say something to themselves, & etc...

Overpriced: Bankier's apts generally tend to give slightly higher price compare to others. If your budget is tight, then choice other apts.

Landlord entre your room frequently: Urbana city require landlord give notice at least one day before they enter your room. However, Champaign does not have such law. Although most of the time, landlord will knock the door before they open your door. There are several times that staff open my door without any notice. Live in Urbana if you really care about privacy.

Overcharging: It is quite often that they charge you for problem that exist when you move in. They refuse to fix those problem and then charge $$$$ for that when you move out. The company also refuse renter to steam clean the carpet by themselves. (If you do so they still charge you carpet clean fee) Therefore, you will have hundreds more bill when moving out compare to other companies. MAKE SURE YOU TAKE PHOTO OF EVERYTHING WHEN YOU MOVE IN&OUT!!! PHOTOCOPY THE CONDITION LIST SHEET before you turn it in.

Dishonesty: Their mouths were full of lies toward international student, and I am not the only victim of their lie. It's quite often that they lie about condition of apts when they *talk* about the room. So you must VISIT THE EXACT ROOM YOU WILL LIVE IN BEFORE YOU SIGN THE LEASE.  Misleading information include mail/package/parking. Take your time read the lease documents! Again, you must visit the exact room!

PS: all these cons were true for old apts, if you live in their new building (e.g. Skyline Tower), then the only problem is overprice.

In summary: Live in Bankier's old build will give you an average to below average experience. (3 to 2 star) Their new building should give you a good to excellent experience. (4 to 5 star).

Others: C-U area generally tend to be very safe (compare to Chicago downtown, & etc...), and this area does not have bed bug problem too. Most of apts are roach free (or the pest control work really well). Most of downtown apts are furnished with acceptable price. TAKE THE COURSE GIVEN BY UOFI TENANT UNION BEFORE YOU MAKE DECISION!!!",,,,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBa0ttSm13RRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x637da24609b4c51b!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICAkKmJmwE%7CCgwIzercygUQwKbt_wI%7C?hl=en-US,2,1498887501,07/01/2017 05:38:21,7,7169064603537949979,16,3,2,7,54

I told her that her maintenance guy “Troy” was acting very weird because he came to my apartment twice *without knocking* to notify us about them painting the door. Thats fine; However, he DIDNT Knock! And she says “Oh maybe you just didnt hear him knock” like its hard to hear a door thats 10 inches away. The second time he came *again* he didn’t announce hisself. He CASUALLY unlocked my door as if he stays here and then when I locked it back he UNLOCKED IT. So now we’re sitting here fighting with the lock because I continuously locked the door. Why would you keep unlocking my door and you clearly see I locked it back. Just weird. I asked him why did he think it was okay to not knock!! He says “Well I knocked the first time I came”

Very Unacceptable. As if it was not just a recent incident with a girl getting killed by the maintenance guy in her building. They were not at all concerned with my safety.

Be aware. Ask to get your lock off master lock. Get cameras do something ladies. Protect YOU at all costs !!",,,,,"HI De’ja,

We are saddened to learn that our response to this situation did not satisfy you. We felt that due to the multiple layers of complexity regarding this issue; offering you an unmastered lock change, rent credit and the option to break year lease without any legal liability or cost would help to address your concerns. We also addressed the way we enter units with our entire maintenance staff and addressed company policy to ensure every tenant has the opportunity to open the door regardless of prior communication as a result of this incident.

We tried to mail your deposit out and it was returned to us by USPS. That is why when you came to our office it was there. Regardless, it is apparent that you were slightly dissatisfied with the service you received from our office and for that we are truly sorry. I hope the clarification gives you some comfort in knowing we did not lie to you in efforts to keep your deposit. Wishing you all the best in all of your future endeavors!

I spoke with the Manager and she was more reasonable and said sorry that we were not informed. She also took my suggestions on how to improve how residents are addressed, and to clearly tell residents where they can park.

They have absolutely no care for their tenants and will only answer you weeks after your initial problem has started.

From the first week that my roommates and I moved into our unit, our AC was broken DURING A HEAT WAVE (over 100 degrees every day). After a week had gone by with nothing on smile's end and SEVERAL calls from us, we eventually got told that there were no fans left for us. Even after we stressed that one of our roommates has a medical condition and has FAINTED MULTIPLE times, nothing was done.

It wasn't until we all went into the office and complained that we got a portable air conditioner unit that didn't event get installed in  all of our rooms. By the middle of the second week, maintenance finally came in and fixed our AC only for it to break again because the coolant added started leaking. We had to call again for them to fix it but by the time that was fixed it was no longer hot and all of us had not slept in the apartment for a majority of the nights.

We paid for a FULLY FUNCTIONING apartment and that was promised to us the day we signed out lease but clearly that wasn't the case. We got in touch with the previous tenants who had the same issues so not only did they fail to inspect the unit before we moved in, but they caused an insurmountable amount of emotional and physical damage to us that could have been easily avoided.

I hope everyone, especially Jonathan feels ashamed for their behavior. I don't care that you feel like you ""failed us"". I care that the safety and well being of my roommates are being ensured instead of ignored. If you had an ounce of empathy for what we had to go through you wouldn't have left us stranded without help during a heat wave for longer than a week. SHAME ON YOU!",,,,,"We apologize, Julia.

Upon beginning our lease, we were informed and agreed upon a non-refundable admin fee of $1,000, which we were led to believe covered basic cleaning expenses. This was straightforward enough. However, after the lease concluded, we were blindsided by several additional charges that seemed to starkly contrast the condition in which we left the apartment.

For instance: Trash Removal Fee ($15) - We ensured the apartment was free of trash when we moved out, so this was perplexing. Oven Cleaning Fee ($50) - The oven remained untouched and unused during our entire stay. This charge is baseless. Washer/Dryer & Bathroom Charges - We were met with vague fees without any detailed breakdown. We treated all amenities with care and are confident that no significant damage was caused by us.

Any minor cleaning required should have been absorbed by the initial admin fee. Despite our numerous attempts to reach out and gain clarity on these charges, our concerns went unaddressed. Such a lack of transparency and communication is frustrating, especially when we prided ourselves on being responsible tenants and maintaining the apartment in good condition.

It's regrettable that an otherwise acceptable leasing experience was marred by this. For future tenants, please be vigilant and ensure everything is documented and clarified to avoid similar experiences.",,,,,"Thank you for sharing your leasing experience at 806 S Third with us.

And I asked for maintenance for more than one week ago and it is remained unsolved even I have called the maintenance office twice, emailed the office, and visited office. The most upset thing is that the office is so unconcerned about the resident's safety issue. I told them the light bulb is hanging there and only connected to the ceiling by a single wire so I am so concerned that it may fall off suddenly. And he told me it is safe. How can I think it is safe if it can easily disconnected to the ceiling? At least the Wampler or University Group property are very prompt in maintenance.

Another unhappy experience, I reported the office the issue that my neighbor keeps jumping continuously in the early morning which causes annoying repeated vibration noise that disrupted my peace and sleep.

Their property management is horrible.

I have been staying at one of their apartments (606 E Stoughton St.) since August and they have continuously failed to provide adequate duty of care to their tenants.

Some examples of their failures (including civil liabilities that they are dodging responsibility for) include:

-For a two-week period, we did not have hot water in our apartment. This violates a wealth of habitability requirements, including Champaign's Rental Habitability Ordinance (Section H), and Illinois's Plumbing Code. We notified management the morning we noticed the issue, and they failed to respond in a timely manner.

-For the entirety of my stay thus far, I have had a crack in my ceiling that allows rainwater (and likely snow) to pour through. This crack also has mold. While we did not originally know that the mold-filled crack went through to the roof, management should have noticed this issue-- yet no one ever actually came to clean the mold. I had to do so myself. A few weeks after move-in (so early-mid September) is when it rained enough for water to leak through. I notified management shortly after, and to this day (October 31, a whole month and a half later) they have yet to fix this issue. This violates section A of the Rental Habitability Ordinance.

-The parking garage has been consistently decaying over the course of my stay. I witnessed a ceiling cave-in mere days after moving in (August 24), which should have alerted management to the structural issues with their garage, yet two months later, I and many other individuals have been finding these white splotches on our vehicles that do not come off.

While this is not an enforceable error, their inability to address the issue shows an excessive lack of empathy and a disdain for their tenants.

-Our unit originally had pieces of floorboard missing near the doorway leading out to our balcony. This issue existed at move-in and was reported at the earliest possible moment. Not only was this not addressed for well over a month, this issue should have been glaringly obvious to management when inspecting the unit.

Smile has consistently failed to uphold the minimum standards of care required legally, and refuses to adequately compensate their tenants, even for the issues they are legally culpable for.

Avoid Smile at all costs. In my opinion, they are morally bankrupt and a perfect example of mismanaged business that only survives due to their oligopolistic hold on college real estate. If you have any issue, to whatever capacity, they will do their utmost to avoid any sort of compassion, empathy, or responsibility for the living conditions their tenants are subject to.

horrible experience -I stayed with them in an overpriced tiny apartment for three years and took such good care of it that it was in much better condition when I left than how I received it (I had received dirty toilet, glass stains on kitchen counter etc... all those were in my move-in report). I left it sparkling clean, even though I had paid a $250 non-refundable fee to be used for 'carpet and light cleaning.' Still, not good enough for Smile. They charged me an additional amount, supposedly for cleaning cabinets, oven, replacing dripping pans, and throwing away trash (a couple of items that a respectful airbnb visitor would forget behind)... I repeat, the apartment was cleaned to professional level, in better condition than I had received it, and it was so small that I can't imagine $250 would not be enough to clean it, even if it wasn't. They never really said what they did with the $250 except the abstract 'light and carpet cleaning.' On top of that, they threatened with sending this to collections if the fee was not paid.

In addition, I had requested to turn in my keys three months earlier because I wanted to leave the country and did not know if I would be back by the end of lease. I was planning to maintain utilities and keep paying rent until end of lease. But it was not good enough for Smile. While it was never written in my contract, they demanded I paid the remaining amoung (3 months of rent in advance) on the day I turned in the keys AND end my contract. That meant, they would have the right to rent out the apartment I had already paid for way earlier than the end of my lease.

Finally, I will say that the apartments are not efficient. For example, this was -- again -- a tiny apartment, a not-too-old construction, but received excessive energy bills, especially during the winter (I had not spent summers there actually for A/C).

Smile play communications, social media, have these supposedly fun events, but do not be mistaken, all these are paid for with cuts in maintenance, as well as extravagant and unfair fee practices at the expense of a revolving clientele in a campus town. Both them and Fairlawn (parent) are companies I now intend to avoid, although I am still in town.",,,,,"We apologize for any inconvenience you experienced during your stay with us, Dora.

Telling the reality of  Smile Students Living, they are only waiting to take your money away, with no proper services. When my roommates and I moved into our apartment a year ago, they made us wait 15 days for the move-in, yet charged us for the whole month. Despite a non-refundable deposit, the place was dirty and infested with cockroaches, indicating that they didn't bother to clean it properly after the previous tenants. And I am sure they might have charged the previous tenants with cleaning charges but even after that it was not provided in a clean state to us, the new tenants. Throughout our stay there were several issues, like dirty couches, heating issues, no water which were fixed in days, but guess what even if we delay the rent by a day they charge us a late fee. HOW PROFESSIONAL RIGHT? Then when its about the time to leave, they'll charge you again for some stupid cleaning charges, even though you paid non refundable caution money and for those 15 days you didn't even stay in the apartment (God knows where that money went).They escalated the rent of their apartments to such a great amount that students were forced to move to other places because who can full fill rent with as basic as $13.5 hourly wages in UIUC. Guess what, where is the money going, yes, you guessed it right in their new BMW's and decor of office.

If Smile Student Living truly aspires to live up to their name, they should focus on providing services that genuinely bring smiles to students' faces, rather than taking away their joy.",,,,,"Sankalp, thank you for sharing your feedback about your experience with Smile Student Living.

They are without a doubt the worst realtors in town. I moved-in early (16 days before the usual move-in) in a new apartment. There were so many issues. They don’t provide extremely basic stuff like a curtain rod, food disposal etc. and they charge a rent of $575/month/person (after $50 off per month) for such a 2 BR/2BA. We had a dishwasher that was not working. I filed the maintenance right away and kept checking on them every other day to send someone but their maintenance department would not anyone helpful responses. After multiple daily calls, and some threats of reporting to tenant’s Union and invoking the right to repair act, they eventually repaired it a full month after the request. We also had a broken mailbox. It took them 2 WEEKS to repair them and another 2 WEEKS to provide the keys (which I had to procure by visiting the office).
DON’T lease from them unless all the realtors are full and you don’t prefer far off-campus living (I would genuinely prefer that than to live in a Smile apartment).
There are also regular incidents of stolen items from the mail room(specifically where the mailboxes are outside of the building) and they take zero responsibility of rectifying the situation.

I lived in two units at the 408 E. Healey property and have never had more problems with my apartments than I did here. The unit was disgusting when we moved in (pics for reference). The carpets had not been cleaned, as promised, and it reeked of cigarette smoke. Our AC broke twice  during the hot beginning days of the school year because the system was so filthy that it stopped working (pic of our air filter clogged with black gunk included). Our fridge also broke and we lost all our food admiring this time. They switched out the fridge with another units fridge but we didn’t get reimbursed for the food we had to replace.

During the time in these two units the following things broke: our dishwasher (had to be replaced), our AC twice, our heat (had to use space heaters and pay an extremely high electric bill - over $200 for the month), our windows weren’t sealed well during winter and our electric was very high and it was freezing in my room, our dryer stopped working numerous times because it was so old and we got a new one eventually, our freezer was continuously leaking water into the fridge and never got fixed even though someone came out at least three times to address it.

Now when I went down this past weekend before my lease ends to clean the apt out the AC was broken again.

Lastly, I was accidentally charged an additional month of rent and instead of refunding me $1219 that I was mistakenly charged they are refusing to return it until they decide to give back my security deposit. This is MY money and they have no right to hold on to it.

I would recommend literally any other company before smile",https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNX6e_7qao7YoEVd_TYqG_jclfiLhZh_cfGeRrd,"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNX6e_7qao7YoEVd_TYqG_jclfiLhZh_cfGeRrd, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPMiINa8rbI95fzM4m4ithyw1E5l5VjQB7-Wq8c, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOuf9OyL8GiLugwh7U3znG3tjIHpzj4f9bsaZc1",,"AF1QipNX6e_7qao7YoEVd_TYqG_jclfiLhZh_cfGeRrd, AF1QipPMiINa8rbI95fzM4m4ithyw1E5l5VjQB7-Wq8c, AF1QipOuf9OyL8GiLugwh7U3znG3tjIHpzj4f9bsaZc1","Thank you for your review, Ashley.

The key fab access was down more times than I can count in the time I lived there and when this happened they just left the doors open. Maintenance and staff were wholly unresponsive the entire time I Iived there, if I needed something too bad because I wasn't going to get help. If you forget your keys or fab (when the fab system is actually working) that is also too bad because they have literally no process for lock outs. In addition to all of this I took incredible care of my apartment and even spent an entire day deep cleaning my apartment before I turned my keys in but they still charged me upwards of $350 for damaged property. The kicker of it is in the after move out inspection images they sent me that showed what I had allegedly broken in my unit they had the completely wrong name attached to it. I reviewed the photos and they charged me a massive amount of money for damage done to another unit by another person. They charged me for deep cleaning of two bathrooms (I had one bathroom), a broken coffee table (I think I would've noticed if the glass top of my coffee table shattered), over $20 for changing my fire detector's battery (nowhere in my lease does it say I needed to replace this and there is no way it cost $20), and countless other charges that in no way applied to my unit. In those images it was clear it was not my apartment and different photos of the same spot didn't even look like the same unit, for instance in one image the bathroom was completely clean and in another there was black mold in the toilet and the shower. I would highly suggest paying a little extra for another property.",,,,,"Rosie, we are sorry to hear this! Thank you for your feedback on the fob system for the exterior doors. We have a lockout process if you do not have the fob for the exterior door or the key for your interior door. We are looking into the move-out charges in more detail. A manager will reach out to you with a resolution to the move-out charges.

I am incredibly frustrated with them. After trying to for days to reach a representative and only getting through to a voicemail, I finally was able to get in contact with a representative to discuss receiving early move in. I spoke to multiple representative, all of whom, lied,  misled me and made false promises that I would be able to move in 2 days to a week earlier than my official lease date. Now, three days before the move in date they said would be possible- they are saying that It would be an option, and are ultimately screwing me over.

Location:
Probs best for engineers, but also next to a bus stop that has lines going all the way to the ARC and to downtown champaign. A block or two from County Market/Green St. as well for food.
Safety:
Open-building style complex, so got a handful of those door-to-door scammers. Packages get stolen if you leave it there for like 5 days. Sometimes there is a homeless dude in the stairwell but he has never done anything harmful for 3 years, so. Nothing particularly dangerous in this area imo.
Apartment itself:
The walls themselves are pretty thick between units/floors, so didn't need to hear my neighbors unless they were outside. There used to be a lot more parties but it's gotten quieter?
Not the newest condition (paint peeling after there were some leaks and stuff one summer) but it was good for the price we had imo.
Utilities: I think ~$80/month max
Management:
It's okay. Smile replaced our vinyl carpeting and mattresses but I wish they gave us more notice/more specific times bc we had to clear out of the apt w/ all the furniture being moved around.
Most maintenance requests were done within the week.
Don't lose your keys though it takes like $100+ to change locks.
Our total deposit of $400 was taken even though it was pretty clean :\",,,,,"Iris, thank you for taking the time to leave this review and sharing this feedback with us. We appreciate all your input regarding the building, the apartment, our office staff, and the maintenance team. Have a great day!

I’ve also asked for any sort of compensation and smile continues to ignore these requests. Do not live at smile as they do not care about their residents.",,,,,"Aditya, we're sorry to hear this. We understand that this is frustrating. We are working with a vendor to repair the elevator. We have communicated with the vendor and will provide an update via phone. We will continue to keep you updated on the progress. Again, we're sorry and hope the vendor can fix this soon.

They said that the doors will have to be replaced. So, unless that happens - for our entire lease, we will NOT be able to close completely or open the balcony doors for ANY of the rooms and will have to live with these gaps and wood around the house! You have wasted way too much of our time going back and forth, adding to the bad experience of already living in a damaged apartment. For continuous 2 months till now, we have had to be behind your team to fix so many issues in this house. Our basic rent is more than other tenants who have much less amount even with rent and electricity cap.

1) The gaps in these of nonfunctional doors that we will have to live with gaps until end of the lease, amounting to high electricity bills and being in a completely locked house. The lease terms warrant a functional unit and not a unit with damaged parts.
2) The smell of this house and the number of issues we faced since the last 2 months, from leaking sink to leaking bathroom, damaged refrigerator and broken parts in the house.
3) The entire 2 months of time we have had to spend going back-n-forth here in these email chains with you.

These issues have hampered our living here for 2 WHOLE MONTHS!!! and we will have to live in this for 10 MONTHS!! We have visited Smile office 5 times till now with no outcome. This is unacceptable!",,,,,"Madhumita, thank you for leaving a review. We are sorry that we didn’t meet your expectations. May we ask why you left a negative review?

Firstly, we were promised a clean and fully done-up apartment at the time of move-in; however, we experienced several issues instead: it was dirty at the time of move-in, appliances were not working properly, the bathtubs and bathroom sinks were dysfunctional for a full week, doors were not opening/closing properly, ethernet ports and AC vents were broken, etc... After a whole month of submitting maintenance requests and regular in-person complaints at the office, they finally managed to conduct most repairs.

Not only that, but the AC has been dysfunctional for 6 weeks now with a broken portable unit and ventilation systems - we had it ""fixed"" 3 times, but each time, the fix only lasted for a single day. This is the fourth time we have requested a repair, and despite promising to get it fully working last week, not only is it still broken but also no-one has come to conduct the repairs. I think there is the issue of accountability since Smile outsources their repairs to third-party vendors who shift the blame back onto the landlord if something is not fixable, and Smile shifts the blame back onto the maintenance team and/or third-party vendors. This recurring pattern
is ongoing even now.

Lastly, each roomate was promised a $100 Amazon gift card at the time of move-in, which we still haven't received. Eventhough I can understand minor delays due to purcahsing a large number of gift cards, 6 weeks and still nothing is definitely pushing it.

I hope someone from Fairlawn/Smile reads this and takes action to resolve our issues as soon as possible.",,,,,"Rahul,

Yes- we read this and are taking action to fix your situation. Based on the submitted work orders, the requested screen repairs were completed, along with the door handle on the balcony coming off. It looks like the AC work orders were opened and closed, but we are still working on a permanent solution for the latest AC issue you are having. I reached out to the maintenance supervisor to take a look, and you should get an update soon. I reached out to the leasing manager to evaluate the execution of leasing specials to ensure your distribution. You should also have an update on that soon.

We are sorry you feel like you are getting the run-around! We are working on bridging the communication gap. Thank you for your feedback, and please reach out to hello@smilestudentliving with additional concerns you may have.

One month after I moved out  (09/01/2022), they charged us with a cleaning fee, and threaten to send unpaid fee to a debt collector at the end of the month (10/1/2022 ) and therefore harming our credit score.
Also they explicitly mentioned that they are handling security deposit disputes ONLINE and not allowing phone or in person conversations.
So I tried emailing them to dispute some of the charges as those charges seems unreasonable on 09/02/2022. Try guessing how long it takes for them to reply me? 1 days? 2 days? Or maybe 1 week? No, it takes them 19 days (09/20/2022) to reply me.

Since I am a subleasing the apartment, some of the damages were there when I moved, so once again I email them to ask about that, since the original tenant is not responding to my email. Of course, I received conflicting information from them and I'm still waiting for their reply.

End edit (09/26/2022)

Subleasing an apartment with them, sent an email inquiring about payment method for weeks and got no reply. Went into the office and was told to send an email to them regarding this issue.

In the contract it mentioned that there is a parking spot available, but nope, you have to pay extra for it and it's not mentioned anywhere in the contract.

Additionally internet is down for a few days now, called their maintenance team on the day it started and provided no help so far. I have to call the ISP myself to fix it.

This is only my second week with them, I can't imagine what will happened if I were to sign a whole year lease with them.",,,,,"We are sorry that we did not meet your expectations. Our team will investigate these matters and reach out to you with an update.

The apartments on Clark all are quite nice; the leasing agents and showing staff are super friendly and will be honest with you when needed. I did not find there to be any mold, rodent, or bug problems where I stayed, which you cannot say in a lot of places at UIUC.

The only things I did not enjoy was generally a lack of communication - when I submitted maintenance requests they would generally just randomly come in while I was gone a few weeks after I submitted it, do the repair, and not tell me or respond to the request; so it was always a surprise. I also rented a parking spot and 5 or 6 times in the year I would come home to one of their vehicles parked in it, and while they were friendly and quick in fixing it or giving me an alternate spot for the day, it became frustrating, especially because a few times they claimed it was not their vehicle and told me to tow only to find out it was maintenance they had hired. In the spring, they showed my apartment 10+ times in the span of two weeks and while they were apologetic about it, I believe I live in a complex full of studios so it became frustrating being basically the model apartment. Comparatively though, these issues are minor for an apartment on UIUC's campus.

I never had any major issues here, and the price I pay on the lease is very fair for a studio. If you're looking for a solid choice to rent from, this is one of two or three agencies I would actually recommend.",,,,,"We are grateful that you took the time to leave us a review, Allie.

There are literally holes on the walls during the winter in my apartment, and I/my roommates requested maintenance and it took forever for them to respond. The water shut off twice without prior notice when I was showering and it was freezing cold. They also charge a lot of money if you want to add people into the contract or to sublease it and they held absolutely zero responsibilities but to initiate the contract... I am not sure how it works but it is absolutely the worst, worse than CPM.
i also think it is important to note that as i moved out they charge me and my roommates over 600 dollars for cleaning but everything was clean. I even have a video of proof. And unffortunately i am living with smile again this year and nothing was cleaned at all when I moved in. The attic and the basement of the house are full of trash. So here is the thing, take pictures of anything that is broken and not clean and make sure save them in a secure place because SMILE will definitely charge you for those fees that has nothing to do with you. Also force them to fix things for you, because you did not break them, so they have no rights to charge you at the end of the semester.",,,,,"We are sorry that we did not meet your expectations.

That being said, when I toured the unit in which I ended up signing I was assured the unit would be cleaned up before I moved in. Yet it was not. The couch was in disarray and adhesives still on walls from previous tenets. When I removed the adhesives, the paint came off with it.

I was also comforted by the representative telling me they could get early move-in fees waived, which didn’t happen. So, I paid all my fees and rent before moving in, then checked the online portal a few days later. It stated that I haven’t paid rent and was accumulating fees daily. I immediately reached out to the team to reconcile the situation. I got a prompt response saying they’d take care of it. Then about a week later I got a message from them asking if I forgot to pay for rent and to pay them immediately!

A few weeks after moving in I blew a tire in the parking lot, which was very costly. After inspection, the parking area was covered in broken glass. Again, I immediately contacted the team letting them know of the issue. It took them two days to send someone out to clean it.

The unreliable internet doesn’t help.

It’s been a bumpy first month with Smile Student Living so far, but the team is very respectful. And Jen is very prompt and tries to mitigate problems, but I think there might be a lack of communication within the company right now with everything going on. Yet I do look forward to working with Sam, Jen, and the rest of the team moving forward.",,,,,"Dear Jordan, thank you so much for the feedback!

Their property management is horrible.

I have been staying at one of their apartments (606 E Stoughton St.) since August and they have continuously failed to provide adequate duty of care to their tenants.

Some examples of their failures (including civil liabilities that they are dodging responsibility for) include:

-For a two-week period, we did not have hot water in our apartment. This violates a wealth of habitability requirements, including Champaign's Rental Habitability Ordinance (Section H), and Illinois's Plumbing Code. We notified management the morning we noticed the issue, and they failed to respond in a timely manner.

-For the entirety of my stay thus far, I have had a crack in my ceiling that allows rainwater (and likely snow) to pour through. This crack also has mold. While we did not originally know that the mold-filled crack went through to the roof, management should have noticed this issue-- yet no one ever actually came to clean the mold. I had to do so myself. A few weeks after move-in (so early-mid September) is when it rained enough for water to leak through. I notified management shortly after, and to this day (October 31, a whole month and a half later) they have yet to fix this issue. This violates section A of the Rental Habitability Ordinance.

-The parking garage has been consistently decaying over the course of my stay. I witnessed a ceiling cave-in mere days after moving in (August 24), which should have alerted management to the structural issues with their garage, yet two months later, I and many other individuals have been finding these white splotches on our vehicles that do not come off.

While this is not an enforceable error, their inability to address the issue shows an excessive lack of empathy and a disdain for their tenants.

-Our unit originally had pieces of floorboard missing near the doorway leading out to our balcony. This issue existed at move-in and was reported at the earliest possible moment. Not only was this not addressed for well over a month, this issue should have been glaringly obvious to management when inspecting the unit.

Smile has consistently failed to uphold the minimum standards of care required legally, and refuses to adequately compensate their tenants, even for the issues they are legally culpable for.

Avoid Smile at all costs. In my opinion, they are morally bankrupt and a perfect example of mismanaged business that only survives due to their oligopolistic hold on college real estate. If you have any issue, to whatever capacity, they will do their utmost to avoid any sort of compassion, empathy, or responsibility for the living conditions their tenants are subject to.

Seven07 was the very first apartment my roommate and I toured when we got here in August (we were looking for sophomore year places). Having never visited campus before, I was so impressed that apartments like this existed. The high-end feel of this place immediately got me so excited to live here. The location is near Green Street too so it was convenient. Even though we had lots of other apartment options lined up for us at the time, we decided to make seven07 our home in September. We chose 2x2 Type 4.

My roommate signed the lease before me for $1290. I was waiting for my dad (my guarantor) to sign his part of the lease. There was a delay on his end since he had spent the day in the hospital back home in California with my grandma, who was undergoing a breast cancer biopsy. He signed 2 hours after my roommate, but by that time I was told the prices had risen to $1310. Given these circumstances that were out of my control, I was upset that I had to pay more than my roommate for the same unit, and it stressed me out a lot. I had my hands full with academics and settling into college life as a freshman, so I let it go and accepted it.

Fast forward to November, seven07 emailed us a contract addendum stating that we were being charged the $25 premium price because they placed us on the 8th floor since they ran out of units on the lower floors. But my roommate and I never opted in for the premium preference in our original contract. It seemed unreasonable to me that we were being charged for the premium because seven07 didn't have enough space to accommodate us on the floor level that we signed for. During a phone call with the manager Nick, I explained to him my family context and why I had been feeling unsatisfied. He was very polite and listened patiently to what I had to say, reassuring me that my input mattered and showing me seven07 values their customers' feedback for improvement. He was able to give us a spot on the lower floor, so the premium charge was cancelled. He even generously made an exception for me to go back to $1290/month. I am very pleased with the way Nick went out of his way to make sure my issues were addressed. I am aware that seven07 is in very high-demand among the students, and it is highly acclaimed. They do care about what their residents say, and I hope they continue to do so in an effort to make seven07 better than it already is. I am excited to move-in sophomore year (fall 2024), and I am proud to call seven07 my home.",,,,,"We appreciate your detailed feedback and are thrilled to hear about your positive experience with our manager, Nick.

Our gym equipment is tended to a minimum of once a week. If there are any issues regarding specific equipment, please reach out to me directly at nick.moon@liveseven07.com, as no one has brought any issues to my attention. 

The indoor basketball court has actively working AC.  The box is locked to prevent anyone tampering with it, but we would be happy to adjust it for anyone - just swing by the office and ask.

The elevators are secured fob access, allowing only residents to get up and down the building. Make sure you are using your common access fob to activate the buttons. We may reprogram your key in the office if you are having continued issues with your fob.

While we can not guarantee 100% safety, as unforeseen things can happen,  we have preventative measures put in place all across the community. You must have a fob to enter the building from any entrance, use the elevators, and access any apartment. Additionally, we have on-site security every night to monitor the main entrance and amenity spaces.

I like my room layout, the furnishings, and the amenities. I wish the kitchen was bigger but the reason why this place gets a 1 star is due to the copious water issues throughout the past year, and the infrequent hot water that residents get. Whoever designed this building and the management responsible for maintaining it have failed to account for the needs of residents when it comes to water.

There have been instances where management have been aloof or straight up missing when there was no hot water in the building, with ice cold water coming from the tap, shower, and faucets. Getting hot water requires you leaving on the shower for more than 15 minutes, making it extremely inconvenient when you want a fast shower. In some cases, I have left my water on for 45 minutes with no hot water reaching my shower. It's always a gamble for hot water, sometimes you can get lucky and can get hot water in 5 minutes, other times you are waiting an hour. It's a waste of water and extremely disruptive to my daily schedule.

Management has promised a permanent solution is incoming but until that is apparent, this review will stay up. I have still not forgiven them for not putting an emergency number up when they closed the office down once for training and hot water for the entire building was not available for 8 hours.  I hope this gets resolved soon in the form of management reducing rent payments or compensating us in another manner because this has been ridiculous.

Update: it’s been a year but i never received any compensation for my issues. Because of this, I have left the review on here",,,,,"Rushil, Thank you for your updated feedback. 
Because we offered all residents two different accommodations for showering, there was no compensation offered.  We worked closely with our off-site vendor to get the hot water restored as quickly as we possibly could.  The issue has been resolved for over a year now with no additional issues or concerns.  If you would like to discuss your concerns in person, feel free to stop by the office and speak with any of the managers.

The apartments are well made. But, the management is absolutely horrible. I have had issues with hot water from the beginning and the building as a whole wastes so much water to wait for hot water to come on is horrible.

The management is unresponsive and the owners are not taking responsibility for it. The residents were told that there would be compensation or reimbursement but there was nothing.

Not to mention the lack of security this building has. There is no one in the building after hours and anyone is allowed to enter at any given point. I have seen homeless men sleep on the couch of the lounge and threaten residents. The management knows this but takes no action for this. Packages are lost on the daily and the management seems to have 0 organisational skill at this point.

Overall, I expected a great experience but had nothing close to it. Would definitely not live here again.

I had decided to live here because I heard good things about it, but unfortunately the hype was wrong. Everything looks nice on paper, but over the last 6 months it has been more irritating than comforting to live here. Maybe I'm just unlucky and some parts won't apply to others but I'm just reporting my experience. Starting with amenities, I feel like nothing works when you need it to. Whenever I need to use the printer, it's broken. My washing machine repeatedly fails to drain the water out. The security system sometimes doesn't recognize your key. In fact, the night I came back from winter break, I would've been locked out of the building had it not been for someone else coming out. For fall finals, I unexpectedly had to rush down 14 flights of stairs to catch a morning final because they hadn't reactivated the elevators due to an alarm the night before; I feel like 8am isn't too early to restart them, no? Shouldn't they know it's finals week and be mindful of certain things? While I was off campus, my room has been entered on multiple occasions without good reason or my permission or awareness, with one of those times leading to something of mine being lost despite them claiming they had nothing to do with it. And finally, the lack of hot water. As you may have seen other reviews have mentioned the staff's inability to upkeep hot water, especially during a snow storm. Thank you for having us wait over a week, I appreciate it. I also just randomly don't get hot water. Some days you just need a nice shower after a long day, but some days you really just can't. It's all these things that add up that make me wish I had lived somewhere else. I certainly won't be returning. 707's a pathetic joke. Go anywhere else.",,,,,"Eli, thank you for your feedback.

Although the amenities such as the gym, basketball courts, and pool are pretty nice, those are all that I can think of as being ""good"". During my period living here, there have been so many issues/red flags. Hopefully, my review can help you rethink and really consider if this is the place that you will want to stay at.

My main concerns come as issues with Seven07 management. In my opinion, they have not been doing a good job at all keeping up with resolving any of the tenants' issues. There was the whole no-hot water situation, where they did the absolute absolute bare minimum to stay within regulations and not get into any trouble. In the first few days where there was no hot water, nothing was done at all. As residents were frustrated with the lack of action, some decided to speak with the Champaign-Urbana Tenant Union, and discuss legal options to resolve the issue. Strangely and interestingly enough, the next day, Seven07 staff put out a notice that they would be implementing a shuttle service to take residents to ARC for showers. It seems quite obvious that they are doing the bare minimum to not get sued, and won't take action unless forced to. Also, they supposedly voted to not provide compensation for the lack of hot water, even though it is clearly on them for not resolving the issue in a timely fashion. I can understand that they want to reduce the overhead and maximize margins, but I will just say this now, they may have ""saved costs"" but at the expense of their tenants' trust. I, along with others, have sent numerous emails asking for details about the compensation and at the time of this writing, over three months have passed, and not a single word has been said. They are trying to brush this off and hope residents forget about it, which goes to show how much they care about your experience as a tenant. One other thing that is indicative of poor management is how they also handle the persistent internet issues. Even though residents from all over the building are reporting the same, consistent issues with the internet connection being spotty, they still want each individual resident to call the internet service provider. Logically speaking, if residents from literally almost every part of apartment are experiencing similar internet connectivity issues, I think that it might just be a larger problem here. It seems that they just do not want to put in the effort to fix these problems.
**My concerns with the management team do not extend to any of the student members. They have been doing a great job, and are always friendly and willing to help.

If Seven07 reads this, and decides to post the same comment saying that I should contact their office, please know that I have already sent numerous emails, and have never gotten a response. I hope to keep this review up to share my experience and provide a different perspective on what leasing an apartment here would entail.",,,,,"Alvin, We realize Seven07 fell short of your resident expectations as well as the level of service you received.

This has been an issue since the beginning of the school year in August 2021. Fast forward to February 2022 and it’s gotten much worse. It’s freezing cold water! There have been instances where I’ve had to shower in the cold water because I had no choice. People have things to do, and worrying about hot water is BY NO MEANS one of those things.
I’ve set up work orders to get it fixed last year and a few weeks ago when I came back in January after break. They came around 4 days after I submitted my work order, and then when they came nothing changed. I also called management but that hasn’t changed anything. I spoke to the leasing manager Brian, and he just asked me why I didn’t place a work order before. First of all, I did place work orders before and second of all, that doesn’t solve my problem. I’m having this problem for a long time, so I would obviously call you. They just tell you the following things from their laundry list of responses: turn your water on for 30 minutes, no one else is having this issue, it’s the weather’s fault. Yeah right. My roommates and I have left the water on for more than 30 minutes and that does NOT do anything (not to mention that it’s a waste of water). With the winter storm, they found out that they need replacement parts for the boiler system. That should’ve been checked well in advance so that this problem wouldn’t arise again in the first place. What’s funny is that the management wasn’t even in the building when there was a cold water outage for us in November because of a shift in management. They have a track record of leaving the building when something goes wrong. Oh, and don’t get me started on the weekly fire alarms, one of them being at 6 am. I absolutely do NOT recommend living here as it is not worth taking showers in freezing cold water. Save your money and find another place.",,,,,"Dev, thank you for your feedback.

This place has had many issues since we have moved in but there had been a persisting hot water issue that I along with my three other flatmates have been facing over the past year. We have actively been in communication with the Seven07 management and maintenance team for 8 months about this problem in our apartment's water heating system.  Our apartment just NEVER gets supplied hot water and management has known about it but dismissed our pleas to get the issue fixed.
However, of course since the snowstorm on 2nd Feb, the entire building is facing a crisis and there is no hot water in the entire building. The management team who I have contacted multiple times has given me vague answers and has not been able to provide me a timeline to when the problem will be solved still.

Those five-star reviews should be rated by their staff. I would give 0 star if I could. It is expensive (over $1000, packages got stolen many times yet the staff does nothing. The building is built cheap, many furniture break easily and they would charge you way more than the repair fee. And it is super noisy. NO HOT WATER after 10 pm, asked them to fixed it but nothing has been done...for a year! Also, Abby Hays is the rudest staff ever. She does literally nothing only repeats that she is not responsible. Useless. I am sure that you could find better and cheaper apartments on campus.
这个公寓真的辣鸡！工人还会在进房间修东西的时候偷东西，向管理员反应，那个废物管理员只会瞪着你然后说不关她的事，所以不负责… 去年火灾把好几间公寓都淹了，也没有赔偿。简直傻逼 快逃啊",,,,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhaE55OThnRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xaa84911bcbf86e1e!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDahNy98gE%7CCgwI7f3miAYQ8JTXzwI%7C?hl=en-US,1,1629077229,08/16/2021 01:27:09,10,-6159638841763795426,58,7,2,11,187

Throughout my time at Legacy202, the staff has always been courteous and proactive - not something that can be said about many luxury apartments in town (speaking from experience). When I was struggling to find someone to sublease my apartment to, the manager Chris and her staff were able to assist me in a timely and efficient manner.

On top of the service, the building is always kept pristine and clean (again, that cannot be said about other luxury apartments in town from my experiences). The lobby is always perfectly maintained and clean, as well as all the other (amazing) amenities offered. The apartments have phenomenal floor plans and great finishes throughout. Maintenance is also fast and efficient.

If you are looking for an apartment near campus, this is THE place to be! :)",,,,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURWM1pQQnRRRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x2915f1df73ec32d6!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDV3ZPBtQE%7CCgwIvcPvqwYQyNitpAI%7C?hl=en-US,5,1702617533,12/15/2023 05:18:53,0,None,0,0,0,0,2
