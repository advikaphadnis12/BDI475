Between the several times I visited, countless problems occurred. The gym, lobby, and study rooms were completely trashed from flooding that occurred because the staff kept the temperature too low. The gym was out of service both times I visited which was 2 months apart. On top of this, the power in most of the rooms barely worked. The outlets didn't function which prevented any charger or lights to work with the exception of the one overhead light. Clearly, the building was built horribly. From my understanding, utility bills were several hundred dollars per person per month which is the most outrageous expense I've ever heard. Next, the hot tub/pool was ""out of service"" pretty much the entire year. There was no explanation for why it was unusable and remained untouched and unfixed until pretty much the last week of classes. The structural elements of this place were ridiculous. For being a newly built apartment building, this place looked like a trashed several decade old build. Walls were cracking and separating from the floor. Also, from the burst pipes I previously mentioned, several tenants' rooms were completely destroyed. From the individuals I talked to, it sounded like they were promised to have their rooms fixed within a couple months. As it turns out, the horrible management failed to have any desire to follow through. Ultimately, these individuals never got to return to their apartments. These ruined parts of the building were essentially a construction site the entire year. Loud fans tried to air out the smell of mildew and paint. Cardboard and dust covered the floors and walls. I'm so glad I wasn't one of the tenants here. I was staying with friends for what added up to be maybe 3 weeks. Those 3 weeks enlightened me to just had bad a residence and a management team can be. The workers were unresponsive and rude. They pretended everything was fine with the apartment while things were clearly in disrepair. From what I heard and saw, maintenance orders went unanswered and unresolved for months. It's insane how much they charge for this place. I would never live here.",,,,,"Hey Jacob, we apologize when you have visited the property it has been a less than pleasurable visit.

This is not a shot at the staff, they are trying, but the building is a mess. The only thing the Standard is good at is making sure they are charging us for rent and other fees.

This includes that they are literally charging 12 months rent for 11 months because they have ""housing contracts"" and not monthly rent. I've never heard of anything like this in my life. They blatantly misled me into believing my monthly rent would be much lower than it is.

1. You are rich af and willing to donate one EXTRA month rent to your future apt, because you will actually pay 12 months of rent for 11 months of living.
2. You love the smell of garbage and enjoy living with trash bags.
3. You desperately want to hear a symphony performed by your washing machine, dryer, AC, and dishwasher.
4. You are interested in flooding scene in Universal Studio Tour but cannot go to LA due to schedule. (You definitely want to try standard, because it gives you a series of authentic experiences: getting notified when your home destroyed by the pipe bursting; rushing back home to pack your luggage; living in a hotel; relocating to another hotel that 4 miles away from central campus; HAVING WAITED MORE THAN TWO WEEKS for them to repair your apt and without getting home until now.

I would be inclined to give a 5-star review, but truth is there are some improvements and critiques.

Critiques:
-The gym itself is fairly nice, but there is certainly some equipment that has been missing/lost for quite some time. Notably, there are dumbell weights that are missing their counterparts.

-Monthly rates have been increasing every year and I've been told that tenants have to start paying for utilities now. This would come out to about a $200/month rate hike since when I first leased. I understand that housing in general is increasing in the area, but the rates here have been rising too fast compared to the building's age and amenities.

-I've heard that the leasing office has been cancelling leases for the next academic term because some current residents have decided to re-lease last minute. This is very unfair for those who have signed the lease a long time ago, only to get notified that their lease is now void. I hope that they get the application fee reimbursed at least.

The positive:
-The staff are very friendly and approachable! They're always willing to help out.

-The apartment units themselves are pretty nice and spacious. The sound insulation is also better than other nearby apartments (although not perfect).

-Prime location, close to Central Campus.

-Overall nice amenities. Gym has two floors that separate cardio and strength training. 13th floor lounge is also very nice, it has a pool table, ping pong table, and a balcony area.

In general, I've really enjoyed staying at the Varsity these past two years. Management did a great job of roommate matching. I would extend my lease if I wasn't graduating.",,,,,"Hi William, we appreciate your honest feedback, as we are always looking for ways to improve.

However, a big con is that the lounge hours are only until 9PM which is a big inconvenience and one of the only comparable apartment buildings in the area with such a restriction.

Furthermore, there has been equipment missing at the gym for a year now. The 15 lbs and 10lbs dumbbells are missing their pairs, and these are very commonly used weights, and there are not enough plates for all the equipment that use them.

Moreover, the management is not very reasonable and unwilling to listen to the community when it comes to amenities and such. They can also be condescending when asking questions.

Lastly, my friends had signed a lease and paid the security deposit and then it wasn't until MARCH that they were told that they were not going to be able to be housed because more people renewed than they were expecting and they had to scramble to find housing since March is very late in the housing cycle for students in Ann Arbor.

Definitely will not be renewing the lease, can find better places in the same location for comparable prices",,,,,"Javier Contreras, thank you for taking the time to leave us feedback about your experience with us and letting us know how we can improve.

I've had so many issues during the 3 months that I lived here, that I don't even know where to begin.
On my first night I could not fall asleep because of the terrible whistling sound make by the bathroom fan. It was dirty as hell so the air could not come through. Also, the bedroom window was really tiny and so dirty that I could barely see any sun light. The next morning I went to the manager and asked if she could send someone to clean the fan and the windows. Of course I tried doing it myself, but the windows and the fan cover were locked. From the manager, I learned that they clean windows only once (!) a year in July. I saw people cleaning the windows a couple weeks ago, but apparently they only clean the front of the building. Today is July 21, and as you can see in the pic my windows are still dirty (I cleaned it a bit where I could reach with my hand).As for the fan, she suggested me to clean it myself. I dont have a skrewdriver, so I had to get used to that terrible sound or just turn the AC off.

Then, the person I subleased the apt from made a payment thinking he was still responsible for them. It turned out, I was supposed to make it, so I did. But that poor guy still cannot get his money back because Varsity returns payments only via checks. The guy is in another country, so he won't see his 1.2k refund any time soon.

Then I got my apartment flooded. Good thing I was nearby that day so I randomly came in for lunch. The hallway was full of water and the alarm was going off but no one cared. I ran downstairs, found the manager, and she sent people over to me. The maintenance crew stopped the leakage and removed water. I was left alone there to deal with the all the dirt, the soaked carpet and my wet belongings. The Varsity team didn't even bother to ask if my stuff was OK.

Today my guarantor has informed me that he received a letter called ""Demand for possession"", in which Varsity threatened to sue him because I did not pay my rent. To say I was confused and embarrassed is to say nothing, because I did submit my payment on time. I had to conduct a full-scale investigation to figure out what happened. It turned out that Varsity did not attempt to charge my bank account until mid-July. I did not know that, and was assuming my rent was paid so made a few other payments. So by the time Varsity actually charged me, there were a few dollars less than needed on my account, and the payment was returned. Neither the Varsity team nor their electronic payment system had contacted me to inform about that. The only thing I received right after submitting my payment was the confirmation of successful payment. This resulted in embarrassment and a $30 fine.

This is worse than VIC. At least they did not charge me anything for attempting to apply to unavailable units.

(2016)

Here at Varsity, once you sign that lease, your happiness is no longer the management's concern. Literally from the moment I arrived for move-in there has been problem after problem. These problems will absolutely go unresolved unless you push through and follow-up with them on the status and even then, they will likely go unsolved. I will tell you of the many many problems I have experienced.

I Paid for the Top Floor Apartment ($100 More), however, upon arrival they tried to move me into a floor below it. After much discussion, they found their mistake and moved me into my top floor apartment which had a filthy floor and reeked of moth balls. I couldn't stand it, no matter what we sprayed the smell stayed. Finally, we found a box of moth balls in our kitchen cabinet. During my first conversation with Varsity Management regarding them putting me in the wrong room, I asked them to switch their records for my mailbox, as I was expecting an important piece of mail. They did not do this, and that important piece of mail had to be re-sent. I checked my new mailbox and saw that the names had never been changed. I informed them of that and they told me that the post office puts the names their as a courtesy and didn't have to do it and that it was my responsibility to change the names - as if I was suppose to know that without them telling me.

After many months of more quietly hating this place and having given up on them being helpful at all, my bathroom started to fall apart. First, the sink lost its temperature control. Up came the genius maintenance staff to walk around the bathroom, turn a knob and declare it fixed. Nothing changed of course, the temperature control was the same. I had them come back up the next day and thank god my roommate was there to hold the maintenance staff's hand. He told him that the issue was happening in his bathroom and the kitchen to. ""it must be the cold water pressure"". He adjusted it, and now the sink has the same lack of temperature control in the opposite direction (Too cold). Afterwards, they did not follow up. A few days later, my shower went on the fritz. The water pressure and temperature varied throughout my shower and the drain stopped functioning. They were able to unclog the drain, but the shower itself is still not right. Once again, no follow up.

I emailed the manger to express my anger with the entire situation and asked that he not only take care of my bathroom, but also take care of my cable that has been out for 8 months. At first he was apologetic, however, the conversation turned when the manager mentioned that I had previously responded to 2 survey follow-ups regarding how well their maintenance staff did on their repairs with ALL 5 Stars. I assured him that could not be correct because I was very upset every time and would NEVER have given them 5 stars on anything. Clearly they had been writing their own follow-up survey reviews. Very smart!

Finally, with my bathroom falling apart, cable after 9 months of waiting, and many many other lies and mistakes, I walked into my apartment, just 1 day after the cable had been fixed. I thought, man is it hot in here! I looked at the A/C and it read 78 degrees and the service button was blinking. ""Crap! This place sucks."" Well, I'll call maintenance and get them up here...I call the listed maintenance number, the same as the leasing office, front desk number, and a few other numbers on their contact sheet, and get the voicemail.

Please do not make the same mistake I made. Do NOT live at varsity apartments in Ann Arbor, MI. They will lie their faces off and will never work their asses off to make you happy. You're a rent check and nothing else. There are much better deal for the amount of money they ask.

To whom this may concern,

I currently am staying in the Varsity apartments in room 1211 with my roommate I have been living there for a 11 days and have numerous complaints and have heard a number of complaints about your staff of the following : horrible attitude, lack of professionalism, and failure to comply with a residents request. I personally have had two issues. The First is the carpet in front of the main entrance of the building where I tripped on it Saturday and asked the front desk if they can please fix it…They did not. I tripped on it again and kindly asked Billie to fix it and he did. Secondly me and my roommate work very early because we are in a corporate setting and we pay a service fee for the building for certain amenities such as coffee. For the past week I asked that the coffee machine please be operational for I have my own mug and I am willing to do it myself. I inform them yesterday and there was an incident I would like to be documented.  I approached ritas office and saw rita was speaking to someone else, I waited outside and then a “community worker” named jenessa (sorry if I got the name incorrect) ask me If I can be helped I asked her about the coffee and she proceed to then sit then in the chair turn her back to me….AND I QUOTE “We aint  gonna wake up before 9 for yall to turn on the machine” She then proceeded to laugh. I was very disturbed by this to the point I felt so uncomfortable I then said thank you and walked out…I then returned a few hours later to informed rita and another supervisor about the situation she then told me and I quote “ I apologize on her behalf but I cannot control how a person speaks.” I found this to be absolutely astonishing in the fact that she is an employee and rita is a manager and speaks to paying residents with this kind of attitude in front of a manager. It’s only been 11 days staying at Varsity and I feel very uncomfortable living here and I should  NOT have too. I would like this to be resolved with not just an apology that doesn’t hold no base but further discipline for which this should never happen again to any of the residents.. I have asked around to other residents other than my roommate and I have heard other attitude problems with this staff (Jeff Hugan room 401) If someone can please get back to me at their earliest convince that would be best before I take further action….

P.S. I did not again get my coffee for this is the fourth time and has been recorded twice.

There have been countless issues that to this day are unresolved.

First: Management. This place has changed management several times over the year, and even though it has gotten better, it is nowhere near where an apartment needs to be. Maintenance is helpful in getting issues fixed I will say. If you go to the office with an issue, good luck. Not only will you be treated like you are idiotic and wrong they never seem to be able to help, such as the case when I was charged a late fee because I had to alter my direct deposit amount to pay the water bill. You pay a whole month’s rent (which is outrageous for what you get) to move in at the very end of August. They allow for maintenance to come in without properly notifying you. I have walked out of my room to find maintenance working on things they did not alert us about at the early hours of the morning. The account in which you enroll in automatic payments is not ran by the Hub and therefore they cannot fix any issues with the program, which there are countless.

Second: The building. To summarize how little issues get fixed, the main wood door of the building was removed in late February and still has yet to be placed back. This is a huge security issue, not to mention we have no real security at the door aside from a lady who locks the hot tub at 11pm. Our room has had countless things stop working like electricity and our ac which still struggles to work. This building was very obviously rushed to ensure it was done before people moved in, and it shows in quality. You can see the wall paper by the elevators coming off and the floors have already had to be redone in less than a year. Not to mention the fire alarm goes off countless amounts of times for no reason (3 times in one week). The amenities that were promised fall short as well. The study spaces are crammed and small. There was an espresso bar and rooftop grills that were promised that were never added. Not to mention things like the rooftop TVs never work, nor is there a way to change channels or sounds.

These issues would not even be permissible if I lived in an apartment that cost $500, let alone over 1k! I hope that students or other people who are interested in living here read these reviews and understand the downfalls of living here. We were all excited to move in at first until we actually started living here. Look into other apartments that have a proven track record of helpful management and little to no mechanical and physical issues. I understand that this is a new building, but the company is not new to student housing which is why it came as such a shock that they seem to not know anything about it.",,,,,"Hi Nathan.

First off, the new management team is really solid (I think many of the negative reviews on here are due to the old management team and also while the building was being finished at the end of construction. The Hub is a brand-new building, so there was a little bit of construction still being completed during move-in. Obviously, that is not the case anymore because the building is completed now). Any time that I have needed something fixed, management is extremely quick to respond and are very polite and courteous. Management also does a very good job of keeping the building clean and running smoothly. I have only had good interactions with them.

Second, the rooms are very nice. Room floor plans are well designed, and the appliances are of good quality. I love my room because it has a beautiful view of Ann Arbor along with a large balcony (some rooms have larger balconies than others, so if this is important to you, make sure you view your room before signing the lease). I’m not aware of many other apartments in Ann Arbor with balconies like this, so this was a huge plus for me. Another thing I like about the rooms is that they come with blackout shades, which keep the rooms really dark. I also got a parking spot with my unit. The garage is very convenient because it is underneath the building and the driveway doesn’t lead out to a busy street, unlike many of the other Ann Arbor apartment buildings. If you have a bigger car, it might be a good idea to request that your parking spot be on the first parking garage level because getting down to the second level might be tight.

Third, the facilities in the Hub are better than any of the other apartments in Ann Arbor I have seen. The Hub has a large rooftop hot tub, steam room, nice workout facility, study room and a pool table. Along with the hot tub, the roof also has a great view of downtown Ann Arbor and The Big House, grills, large/comfy chairs and two fire pits (loved the fire pits during the fall season).

Fourth, the Hub is in a fantastic location. It is close to campus and is also near many of the best restaurants and bars in Ann Arbor (you will probably have a lot of friends over because of this!). Living around South U will put you closer to some of your classes, but it will certainly disadvantage you when it comes to food options and nightlife. I have lived in Ann Arbor for six years and this is by far the most convenient location I have lived in. Another aspect I enjoy about this location is that it is easy to escape from Ann Arbor and hangout by the river or run/hike trails, as they are less than a mile away.

Now that the one year learning curve has been surpassed, I think future residents will have a really good living experience here.",,,,,Thanks for the review Billy.

I second the other comments made about unprofessional and condescending staff, the small study lounge, and the roof closing at 11pm, but here are just a few of the many issues I have had:

Our apartment has been barged into twice by staff members/maintenance without notice and without consent for non-emergent reasons. They even tried to walk into my bedroom to put a new drawer in there while I was sleeping. Thank goodness my roommate woke up in time to stop them. When addressed, management made up excuses as to why we were never informed about another drawer being delivered and said it was justified because they knocked. We don't feel safe in our own apartment because our privacy means nothing to management.

Even though it's brand new, 90% of the construction being done now should have been done before move in. The fire pits were just fine when I moved in on Aug. 1 but have been blocked off and ""under construction"" for a month and a half now. I haven't seen anyone working on them in weeks. On the rare occasion where work is actually done, they drill and hammer before 8am which is absurd.

The floor in the lobby was torn up and no email was sent to residents letting us know that we couldn't go out the front door all week. The manager promised to me personally to send out an email to all residents when the floor was going to be torn up.

All of the above have been addressed with management, nothing has been done, and it is unacceptable. We are taken advantage of because we're college students. If this were a building for adults with full time jobs, this would absolutely not be tolerated.

I have never written a review before because I have never felt that it was necessary until now. I'm stuck here for a year blowing tons of money on a place that is not at all worth it and I hope this saves others from doing the same.

Update: I was told a year ago that all utilities would be covered except for electric. In December we got a water bill and had no idea it was coming. It is January and we just got five gas bills for August, September, October, November, and December that will be added to next months rent. Again, it was advertised to us that we would not have to pay for anything but electric.",,,,,"Hey Madison, I'm sorry to hear about your bad experience so far with The Hub.

The amenities were promising and it seemed really nice, which of course meant a more expensive price. Me and my roommate decided to splurge a little and sign on, super excited to have such a nice place.
Fast forward, almost two months after move in, and I cannot regret my decision any more. There's construction that goes on for hours right under my room thats so loud I cannot sleep and the walls are practically vibrating. They close off the roof at 11 pm so I can't go anywhere else to study and the first floor is cramped. The ""amenities"" of a study lounge and business center all look beautifully designed but they're small and impractical.

While the building is clean and brand new, everything breaks down. The steam room in the gym has been broken for a week and after my six personal requests to the Hub staff, it has STILL not be fixed.

The management staff are extremely rude here; they try and send you away when you want to talk about any issues with the apartment with a very snooty and stuck up attitude. They are treating us like we are second-class citizens and not residents paying a fortune to be here.

The construction is extremely annoying. The Hub claims to promote a student-friendly environment; however loud drilling at 6 am in the morning waking students up only adds stress, deprives sleep, and makes the perform horribly in school.

Moreover, the amenities advertised such as an espresso bar and grills on the roof were never delivered. And the horrible American Campus Communities, their parent company, are extremely unhelpful in resolving these issues after I have called them multiple times.

I have addressed these issues and many more not only with The Hub staff but also American Campus Communities and they refuse to help me or any other residents in the Hub. They are completely idiotic, unprofessional, and disgusting human beings running a terrible apartment complex.

I strongly urge, beg, and plead any University of Michigan students or persons in general to NOT SIGN A LEASE IN THE HUB ANN ARBOR.  You will regret your decision as does every single current resident of the Hub.

Varsity (across the street), Six Eleven, Arbor Blue, etc. are all much better places to live in for a better price; or get an off campus house or use the school dorms because The Hub Ann Arbor is atrocious and a failure.",,,,,"Sahil, thanks for your feedback about The Hub.

This year I saved up and decided to move in here with my job and school being within 1 min walk. I came in with very high expectations and that lead to disappointment.

I’ll leave my review and try to be critical in hopes of helping other deciding to live here next year (I will not be returning next year due to my main requirement not being satisfied).

Cons:
- Main attraction for me was a steam room, I was ready to pay my last money just to have a steam room access since its so deeply rooted in my cultural upbringing. Sadly in the past 8 month it has been broken 9/10 times I check. I am very sad about that.
- There are many ’stealthy’ fees that will hunt you during your stay here. Make sure to ask about all of them upfront.
- Hot tub has been under construction several times, latest one being over a month long!
- Music in the gym/elevator just turns on and off all the time which is very distracting. I have to always wear headphones when I work out. Also gym does NOT have any barbells which was a big disappointment for me.
- Many reviews here mention the noise isolation being an issue. Ditto! I hear my roommates walking in the kitchen, the bathroom and even their own spaces like they are in my room. Wakes me up at night and throws my days off quite a bit.
- Kitchen exhaust is so weak, you won’t even notice that it’s on. I called maintenance thinking it was broken, gentlemen told me this is expected and they won’t do anything about it.
- Internet is really fast, but occasionally (3-4 times a month) goes out completely for an hour or two, and as a gamer this was unacceptable. Support gets back within 24hrs telling me there is no problem or it has been resolved!
- You will be paying for 12 installments for rent but won’t be able to live there during August 🤷‍♂️

Pros:
- ⚡️Blazing-fast fiber internet! It takes 1 min to download or upload 5 Gb (very good for streaming 4k or gaming)
- 📦 Package-delivery is very professional with new self access technology!
- 🏢 The new management is very helpful and outstanding in every way!🤞
- 🔧 Stuff gets fixed almost instantly, you call the number on the fridge and the guy shows up basically.

Note to the owners: Personally I think American Campus should try putting Students before their bottom line first. This is a big trend in the past decade and it does pay off huge dividends in future. Current management at the Hub is very good but hearing “NO” so many times makes me think their hands are tied and it leaves a really bad taste in my mouth.",,,,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjZ3YzYk9REAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xd4a04e79a90241ff!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDcgv3bOQ%7CCgwI9oG6_AUQyMLDsAE%7C?hl=en-US,1,1603174646,10/20/2020 06:17:26,11,-3125411856961617409,32,2,0,6,130

First, management needs improvement. I signed up with a friend in October a year before my lease began, and we requested to be roommates for a 4 bed 2 bath. 2 months before move-in, my friend called the Hub to ask if we were assigned 2 more roommates. They informed her that she and I were assigned to different rooms and fixed the mistake, but if she hadn't called we definitely wouldn't have been roommates??
Then, on the day of move-in, my friend walks in to our unit to discover a random person in there. When she walked down to the leasing office, management informed her that we were assigned 2 new roommates. However, they neglected to inform us of this before move-in, so we now have duplicates of all kitchen items. Very unprofessional.

Second, my friend and I signed up in October for the ""early bird rate,"" but in March they were offering the same unit for a more discounted price, so we felt cheated. There is no incentive to signing up early, and I don't advise signing here at all.

Little nitpicky things: 1) The sink is flat, meaning food particles sit there and do not slide down the drain naturally unless you physically move them using a sponge. 2) The walls are super thin and you will hear every word of your roommates' conversations if they talk on the phone.

I do want to say that since I've moved in I haven't had any other issues, so hopefully the management is improving.",,,,,"Hi Kaylee, Thank you for being open about your experience—your feedback helps us to further improve our services at Hub Ann Arbor.

There were countless mistakes in the construction of the building that were clear oversights-I'm honestly not sure how some of these things were possibly overlooked. There is no place to park or stop in front of the building, no driveway, etc. There hasn't been a front door to the building for about 4 months, because the first one was ridiculously heavy. There wasn't recycling in the building for the first three months. Things break constantly-I have a friend who can't keep his lights on for more than 10 minutes without them shutting off. The rooftop has speakers and TV's which sounds nice, but the speakers blast pop music that you can't turn off, and I still haven't found a way to turn on or off the TV's, let alone change the channels. The promised ""study space"" is tiny, and really just not practical to use. There's often been no notice to residents that work is going on in the building, and there's been several mornings where I've been woken up bright and early by the sound of a power drill or a hammer banging away nearby--for any student, this isn't ideal at all, and I feel like this should be something that would have been made right by a simple notice or alert beforehand. Really simple things have gotten consistently overlooked throughout the year, and this was really surprising to see from a company that has experience operating similar properties.

The management has changed several times over the year, but no matter who is in charge of the building, they've been unresponsive and hard to reach throughout the year.

I'd also like to point out that several of the ""five star"" reviews of the building were written by people who also work for Hub, so I'd read those with a grain of salt.

Simply put, if you're going to spend the money that Hub charges, do so somewhere else and get what you're paying for. If you choose to live at Hub, you will not get your money's worth from the experience, as I found out throughout the year. There isn't one glaring issue, but many smaller ones that add up to what I can only describe as a frustrating experience throughout the year.

A bright spot is the maintenance team, who are awesome, responsive, and super friendly.",,,,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURrbGJLeHJnRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xd4a04e79a90241ff!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDklbKxrgE%7CCgsI7v7t6AUQqPXvNw%7C?hl=en-US,1,1562083182,07/02/2019 15:59:42,10,-3125411856961617409,32,2,0,6,130

The management was a huge problem when I moved in, they skipped things like background checks and ended up placing me with a dangerous felon as a random roommate (yes, it's just as bad as it sounds). The security people have however remained the same despite being utterly useless and frankly creepy in how they interact with you, specifically watching any women and girls in the gym and hot tub. Since being overhauled management and maintenance has improved and is literally the ONLY bright spot of living experience.

The real problems with the building would require the whole thing to be torn down and rebuilt far better. In both apartments the utility bills were outrageous because none of the windows are insulated making it impossible to keep a constant temperature especially in any heat or cold. In my first apartment our electrical circuit would trip constantly, lighting fixtures fell apart, my roommates toilet would constantly bubble over because of the hot tub plumbing, and you could always hear the plumbing from the apartments above. In my new apartment you can hear everything on the roof, everything in the elevator area including the elevator moving, there is hardly enough storage for the two people living there right now let alone 4 people, the windows + ceiling + floor leaked for months, I have no ceiling fan, and my bedroom is pitch black even on the brightest days because the single window is 1 foot from a wall. There is no driveway or place to temporarily park or get picked up in an Uber/Lyft (a HUGE complaint).The main pull of the rooftop hot tub is utterly disgusting. Everywhere that can be rusted is rusted, the jets rarely work, the TV's and sound system don't work anymore and even when they did no one knew how to work them, the lounge chairs and cushions REEK of sweat, the outdoor showers don't work anymore, and the fire pits haven't been functional since September. There is constantly some type of construction going on to try and patch up the sh**ty building job.

Just don't live here, the amount of headaches the buildings problems alone will cause you will make you regret paying American Campus Community even a cent.",,,,,"Hi Margaux.

I have lived here for a year, this is written BEFORE phase 2 has opened, here are my pros / cons.

PROS:
>Great entertainment options to rent out hourly for events, pool area is awesome during the summer.
>Michelle and Kaitlin are who I have interacted with most and have been able to help me out with many issues.
>New appliances, modern design, definitely an impressive space to live in overall.
>Monthly resident events often with free food and the opportunity to meet your neighbors.
>Back-up generators for when the power goes out and unfortunately this occurs semi-often in Michigan.
>Remote entry from your phone, very convenient for guests.
>Covered parking, and most of the time you park on the floor you live on (this will only be for Phase 1, not for the new building).
>Walking distance from UMICH medical school and hospital.
>Secure package room for larger mail deliveries.
>Non-smoking building ** SEE CON BELOW **

CONS:
>Nothing is included, you pay trash, electrical, gas, internet, water, parking, everything.
>For $20 a month the trash system is a J O K E, the photos attached reflect that. You will notice another review from nearly a year ago stating the exact issue with photos as well. It will not improve. AVOID living by the trash chutes at ALL cost unless you do not mind being partially blocked in I'd estimate once a month.
>Residents drive erratically in the garage. PLEASE watch children and pets when in the garage and also when driving as well because these residents do not care. Issue persisted after speed limit signs were hung, most likely will continue unless speed bumps are installed.
>Overall cleanliness of the building has decreased in the last 6 months: trash in stairwells, stains on carpets. Management will have spots cleaned if you complain but overall the entire hallways require cleaning I would say 2-3x a year professionally for the traffic it receives.
>The gym air conditioning often goes out, I think it has been out for several months at this point, it will reach nearly 80 degrees fahrenheit on some nights, management says they've tried to have it repaired but basically that means get used to it.
>Construction on phase 2 is agonizing. Streets will be blocked at random times, work will begin as early as 5:30 in the morning. If they are to develop the last parcel of land (which is fenced off currently) AVOID living anywhere your apartment window would see it because that means you will hear noise for over a year if they choose to develop that too.
> ** While the building is non-smoking, residents have a free for all after management leaves **

I have already raised all of these cons to management, it just does not improve, thus why I say be ready to compromise. Other issues have been resolved thankfully; they do listen. For $25,000 a year though, I do wish I had to compromise a little less.

If you have the opportunity to live in a high-rise in Detroit or Royal Oak etc, do it, it may even be cheaper. If you are needing to live in Ann Arbor, all things considering (though the trash issue is unacceptable) Beekman is one of 3 places I would consider living in, which is why I still do.",https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNKCQmc1YduElbFlrK_RVugV5DkpU_7LoVmM0ss,"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNKCQmc1YduElbFlrK_RVugV5DkpU_7LoVmM0ss, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJ0geA9s490_STlWvlrB-EntFv24bhTDvdXZvv, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1fLQgO99UKhLGkNpTAAdK-OcobOsHGfFjmYne, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNaYA10miJmXo2Y9PsxVj5FoYGsxwW4wEpslZ5d, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPbQImeYGeXa9h9Pfs7esM5ny7mGSeSdoyBphaF, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNii9cIo4CLJjnhWr3a_zRWkQGh7Sc0iA5XYqrj, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM854srgGjjdK1xJtNC2tWHXIHYB2OYuju-_kUG",,"AF1QipNKCQmc1YduElbFlrK_RVugV5DkpU_7LoVmM0ss, AF1QipMJ0geA9s490_STlWvlrB-EntFv24bhTDvdXZvv, AF1QipN1fLQgO99UKhLGkNpTAAdK-OcobOsHGfFjmYne, AF1QipNaYA10miJmXo2Y9PsxVj5FoYGsxwW4wEpslZ5d, AF1QipPbQImeYGeXa9h9Pfs7esM5ny7mGSeSdoyBphaF, AF1QipNii9cIo4CLJjnhWr3a_zRWkQGh7Sc0iA5XYqrj, AF1QipM854srgGjjdK1xJtNC2tWHXIHYB2OYuju-_kUG","Hi Daniel:
Thank you for your review.  We are happy that you are enjoying our resident events, appliances, and our location.  We enjoy having you as a Resident.  With regards to the cons mentioned, we do our best to maintain our building properly.  We apologize for any inconvenience you have experienced.  The concern with the trash that are experiencing stems from the weekends where the City does not collect trash on Sundays.  As you know, it is cleaned up first thing Monday mornings.  Unfortunately, it is clear some neighbors do not follow proper protocol.  The same can be said with regards to the parking garage as we have previously discussed.   We appreciate your feedback and always take it under advisement.

Having lived here for a little more than a year, while the apartments and amenities do look nice and chique from the outside, the living experience gets overshadowed by two main issues: terrible noise insulation and trash disposal issues.

1.) Noise issues

- You will be barraged to a cacophony of annoying noises throughout the week like construction, lawn mowers, garbage truck disposals, fake fire alarms, and of course, very obnoxious & loud neighbors. These walls, like most apartments, are SUPER thin. Personally, I had to constantly complain to management about marbles rolling across the floor, thumps, and loud bass music that shook and reverberated my walls, especially at later hours of the night. It took a whole ~6 months before my upstairs neighbor finally got the message to stop making obscene noises, and even then, it still happens on occasion. In the contract clause you sign, it’s one of the things that’s glossed over. Be sure to understand where your room is situated relative to the ruckus (i.e. my room is right near the lawn and construction site, so good luck trying to sleep in some days). Management has tried to alleviate and taper off the scheduling for these noises, but it’s unavoidable. The whole spiel about “concrete walls” used to help with noise insulation is an absolute joke.

2.) Trash disposal issues

- The trash chutes and disposal room become full and overflowing really quick. Come July-September, the trash chutes and hallways are ESPECIALLY filthy.  I’m assuming this is caused by the influx of neighbors who don’t know better (hopefully). A lot of inconsiderate neighbors who have no regard for keeping the public complex sanitary. People are not meant to clean after your trash.

LEARN HOW TO BREAK A BOX DOWN AND TAKE IT TO THE TRASH ROOM OR DUMPSTERS OUTSIDE.  DON’T JUST DUMP YOUR OVERFLOWING TRASH IN FRONT OF SOMEONE’S DOOR. This is one of the things management should really enforce and better orient people who first move-in.

Final thoughts:

Overall, for rent that is ~$1900-2k+ per month and DOES NOT include any amenities, Beekman charges high rent prices that rival some parts of NYC and California. Yes, the management are kind and empathetic and the amenities are nice (i.e. gated parking, gym, package room, pool).  However, I wouldn’t recommend living here unless you are absolutely dead set on it and choose a good room that’s oriented away from the noise hub. There’s definitely better and more cheaper options unless you need to live near the Medical campus or have wealth to flaunt. Plus, the rent only gets more expensive each year without any special added benefits (classic Ann Arbor housing market and zoning ordinances at play). I had to haggle to negotiate my inevitable rent price increase.

Misc. Comment
Also, as a side note, this place also attracted the crowd who feel the need to overcompensate for their ""lack of personality"" with flashy sport cars. Even though it’s a small sliver of residents, I feel it’s important to note that the garages are not meant for you to speed and use as a Thruxton race track circuit. People and families live here, please do not run them over.",https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOCLe7rBXpY9qnTxex_bomGPYtay4M3oSMZwT6o,"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOCLe7rBXpY9qnTxex_bomGPYtay4M3oSMZwT6o, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgSH-IL3Gu3po0Lk_AHw8Nw670fQCLjvwU9gr2, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPPjmOGNQTxX46OhAKBGKxQkwGc4H6gt-qt23rE, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMY7MrTnMmm96Ah3uN_IOxLDYNqvK5c9HxS2qAc, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOMRi09vqlNsT1szjG0zr50uktin2KuNDuhvOsr, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPoNeZdbZVL9xHDjPp-4tQV2EzmGiHeEqAaH-yf, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2SL4cuV18clBn-n1seiIYx1gFlbV9WuHbjJDX, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM-2E2qMkcWHNsTczMRyNAZvPftUaxnK9-TpTGX, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMpfIvbchas1ntVB8DNlnwWauujDHYKAY2OkvLT, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOyWZu07HChcslK8Rh70o-V3nBKWUSzsdC26kX_, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPF748j57wgcrbrbImHZbVgXw7v0XVgCrsXOAAY",,"AF1QipOCLe7rBXpY9qnTxex_bomGPYtay4M3oSMZwT6o, AF1QipOgSH-IL3Gu3po0Lk_AHw8Nw670fQCLjvwU9gr2, AF1QipPPjmOGNQTxX46OhAKBGKxQkwGc4H6gt-qt23rE, AF1QipMY7MrTnMmm96Ah3uN_IOxLDYNqvK5c9HxS2qAc, AF1QipOMRi09vqlNsT1szjG0zr50uktin2KuNDuhvOsr, AF1QipPoNeZdbZVL9xHDjPp-4tQV2EzmGiHeEqAaH-yf, AF1QipP2SL4cuV18clBn-n1seiIYx1gFlbV9WuHbjJDX, AF1QipM-2E2qMkcWHNsTczMRyNAZvPftUaxnK9-TpTGX, AF1QipMpfIvbchas1ntVB8DNlnwWauujDHYKAY2OkvLT, AF1QipOyWZu07HChcslK8Rh70o-V3nBKWUSzsdC26kX_, AF1QipPF748j57wgcrbrbImHZbVgXw7v0XVgCrsXOAAY","Hi SWD:

They have to live in a hotel for months even though they signed a lease and we’re guaranteed a move in date. Don’t lease units that aren’t ready. You screw over peoples’ lives and make work and school infinitely harder. I have watched the stress this has put on her and other residents waiting for their units. They should be refunded for the first few months of their rent as this is ridiculous. So unprofessional and poor poor communication.,,,,,"Hi Kamryn,

They are dishonest and rude, don’t care about tenants!!
I had signed my lease in May for an apartment at Beekman.
I was notified end of June that the apartment we had leased starting July 19th wouldn’t be unavailable until August 4th due to construction delays. Tenants choosing to keep the original lease would receive $175/day for two weeks. I was moving from out of town, starting graduate school and was scrambling to find last minute housing and temporary storage!!
I called on the morning of July 28th to confirm the move in date and was assured it was good to go for august 4th. Shortly thereafter I received an email informing me that the move in was now scheduled for mid-October. Furthermore, they would not be providing any additional compensation each day (essentially I had a week to find a new apartment). I went into the leasing office to speak with Michelle, the manager, to see if she would consider leasing a similar apartment in a different building at the same price. Michelle would not budge, flatly refused even though she controls the lease prices and manages them and has available units. Michelle refused to show any empathy in the situation and promptly responded saying “at the end of the day this is a business and profitability is important”.  When asked if she felt that profitability is more important than ensuring that future tenants are not displaced, she immediately asked me to leave her office. While I understand profitability is important, Michelle’s rudeness in dealing with tenants, and her dishonesty was shocking. They have a listing of available apartments yet it was disappointing and frustrating that Beekman has no mutually agreeable solution for displaced tenants!!  Many of us have started graduate schools and are now scrambling to find last minute housing!!",,,,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNwMU1HaU53EAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xa9a444bc4dd16f8e!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICp1MGiNw%7CCgwInJKUpgYQ2JLMtQM%7C?hl=en-US,1,1690634524,07/29/2023 12:42:04,35,-6222773209569071218,23,1,3,8,48

We sincerely apologize for the noise disturbances experienced within and around our community.  We want to work with our vendors to see if we can lessen the noise levels to an extent within our capabilities.

We've received a few reportings recently regarding excessive noise from our trash collection vendor who services our community route Monday-Fridays.  We reached out to our vendor's routine manager again today to see if we can push back the trash collection time scheduled from 5AM-7AM to 10 AM in order to remedy this concern for all.  Out onsite team will continue to follow up with the vendor service within the next few days to ensure the schedule change has been made.

After reaching out to not only the account manager and route manager we've worked out a solution that should alleviate the noise level.  We do apologize and thank  you your patience as we work through the schedule change for the pickup times.

Feel free to reach out to our property manager, Michelle, if you have anything else we may assist with.   Michelle, our property manager can be reached by calling 734-366-4236 or via email at MRodesiler@MorningsideUSA.com.   Thank you for sharing your feedback and if I can be of assistance don't hesitate to reach out to me via email at jcaroom@morningsideusa.com.

The community is active with all kinds of activities each month. You can find amenities like well-managed pools, grills, and play stations here to enjoy. The fitness room is what I recommend the most, clean and equipped with various types.

Overall this is a new and modern-style apartment. Electronics everywhere, especially the access control to doors, parking, and package room, making life easier. Worn-out, or malfunctioning due to lifetime is the least thing to worry about here. The staff here will regularly do the in-door checks for some equipment, and their response to problems from tenants here is fast and efficient.

One thing I want to appreciate the most is the apartment design. All units are built surrounding the in-door parking space. The door-to-door distance from the unit to the car can be within 2 minutes, really cool and convenient. For those who consider living here, I highly recommend them to take a visit to the parking space.

You signed lease and it said there would be construction”. Of course construction must be  written in the wee tiny print. Management could care less about any complaint & could care less about resolving any issues. We asked several times to move to another location to back of building (hoping noise will be better) and management refused and said no apartments available.  The amount of money you pay to live here, you would think they would compensate tenants or try to appease them in some way, but they do nothing!! Very disappointed living here and complete waist of money.  I am counting the days when my lease it over and can actually get quality sleep.",,,,,Thank you Ravita for your review.  I am so sorry that you are finding the construction traffic disruptive.  I have reached out to the construction team regarding the start time.  We are working to resolve this concern.  We do have a one bedroom apartment available on the other side of the building.  Please visit the leasing office to discuss further details.  We strive to have a positive experience for all of our Residents and welcome all feedback.

1.	Early morning ( 4-7 a.m) harsh noises

I rarely experienced a restful night of sleep while I lived in this apartment.

I was always awaken between 4-7 a.m. by harsh noises from either

a.	the garbage truck at ~5-7 a.m., particularly when bangs the metal garbage container to garbage truck to empty out container or when it makes a loud beeping alarm when it drives back forth
b.	 Construction which mostly starts at 7 a.m.
c.	the loud blow horn of the nearby Amtrak train at ~4:30 a.m.

I used earplugs all throughout my stay here, but all of the earplugs that I tried weren’t able to help me not be awaken by the noise.

2.	Unhealthy air quality due to construction outside

With the construction right outside, the air quality was unhealthy. The construction dust and debris can be smelled in both outside and inside the apartment complex.

I frequently experienced tightening of my chest when I lived here and much of it probably had to do with living around the construction dust and debris.

3.	Rude and dismissive management
Management has a mean and careless attitude towards residents. With that in mind, they’re not reliable in resolving problems residents have.

Once my lease ended, I was relieved that I didn’t have to deal with these issues anymore. Or so I thought!

I thoroughly cleaned my apartment for two whole days and they charged me with a $300 cleaning fee at move-out. Management seems to unjustifiably charge a cleaning fee no matter whether residents clean their apartment thoroughly or not.",,,,,"Thank you for your review Clement, we truly enjoyed having you as a resident.

As the construction progresses, the noise problem has improved a bit. It is less noisy, but the beeping sound is still a bit noisy before the end of the construction in the afternoon.

--------------------------------
An irritating bad environment.

The apartment itself is good, but the surrounding environment is extremely terrible, especially the NOISE problem. The beeping garbage truck dangling in front of the apartment every day before 7AM.

The residents on the south side of the apartment have never had quality sleep.

The apartment owner seemed willing to negotiate to let the garbage truck handle the garbage a few hours later, but the result of this negotiation only lasted a few days.

As a tenant, I can understand the construction requirements in front of the apartment. But why work from 7AM in the morning to 3 in the afternoon? Why can't the apartment postpone the time to give tenants a quiet morning and adequate sleep?

What's more puzzling is that all the construction machines are beeping non-stop. I do understand that this kind of large machine needs to remind people behind to pay attention to safety when reversing, but the machines on the construction site are reversing more than 60% of the time. Wouldn't these drivers drive forward? Is this to save fuel?

The soundproofing effect of the apartment itself is very poor, this kind of continuous sharp and harsh sound affects people's hearing very much and has huge torture to the tenants' nerves. If construction is necessary, why can't the apartment be installed with soundproof glass? For cost considerations, soundproof glass can be installed only for the south room.

The replies received from the email communication basically indicate that they cannot solve any problems: because the lease agreement states that there will be construction problems, so the tenant is responsible for the noise generated.

Maybe only when I make an evaluation on a publicly evaluated website like Google Maps will I get the apartment owner’s attention. But what I want is a noise solution, not ""please come to my office to discuss the problem"".

In addition, the air environment on the south side of the apartment is extremely poor due to construction. I don't know if the air POLLUTION is also written in the contract and the tenant is responsible for it. But people with allergies and asthma can be very uncomfortable.

Considering that the construction in front of the apartment may last for several years, I strongly do NOT recommend students and people who need work to rent this apartment.

This is the second time posting this message, the owner of the apartment or some individuals framed and deleted my last comment.",,,,,"Hi T:
Thank you for your review.  We appreciate your feedback.  The City of Ann Arbor handles the trash pickup.  We have contacted the City on several occasions asking for a later pick up.  Unfortunately, the pick up time is beyond our control as the City is responsible for the schedule.  We apologize if this is disruptive to you and have tried to remedy the issue, but the City is unwilling to alter the pick up route for a later time.  Regarding construction, the second building is slated to be completed next Spring.  The contractors are on a strict schedule per their contracts.  If you have a typical work schedule, the activity should not be disruptive to your personal schedule.  Again, we apologize that the activity is disruptive to your personal schedule.  If you would like to further discuss options available to you, please contact our leasing office.
Best,

This is a relatively new apartment in the Ann Arbor area so the rooms and most of the amenities in the building are in great condition and also up to date. I think for me, the most impressive things about this apartment are:

-	The community has a covered parking lot and it’s super convenient for residents to access their cars just steps away from their homes (basically the whole building is a combination of a parking lot and rooms, so it provides great convenience without making any noise or problems)
-	The staffs are very friendly and responsive. Lauds to the great ladies in the leasing office as well as the cool guys responsible for maintenance. They might be a little bit busy during the peak times (like August of each year when students are moving in), but still willing to help then. Most of the time, they are always there to help with any questions or problems you may have
-	The neighbors are also great people. Some of the residents are students in the university, but there are also local people working around the city. They are all very friendly and I didn’t have any unpleasant experiences with neighbors. The community holds resident events every month so one has the chance to get to know your neighbor
-	Great location on Broadway Street. Several great restaurants just across the street from the building with different styles. I really like the newly opened Plate. It’s also close to the North Campus of the university so it’s convenient to go to school even by bicycle. Of course, if you have a car, there won’t be any problems at all.
-	The amenities provided are really great. Basically, all you see on the website are actually there for you to use, not like some apartments that just put fake photos and statements

Several potential downsides of the apartment (I don’t want to use the word “cons” because personally I don’t think these things below are problems, or at least don’t bother me much)

-	I heard some people are experiencing noise problems due to the nearby construction site. I can’t speak for other people but at my unit, I didn’t experience any noise at all. Maybe with the progress on the site, the problem shouldn’t last long (at least it should be alleviated)
-	The price is indeed kind of high compared to other communities around the area. I would say it’s overall worth it, but it’s understandable that some people feel this might not be a good match for them
-	Most of the units are unfurnished, so this might cause some problems for those who just arrived in the city (or the country). But as long as you manage to get some furniture later, you can create your own sweet home. I heard the apartment also has some furnished floor plans, but not many.
-	Yeah, there are small problems with the apartment operations occasionally (like false fire alarms etc), but I can see that the management teams are trying their best to solve these problems and create a good living environment for everyone here

Anyway, I would say this is a great place to live. As a new international student who just arrive at the U.S. last year, Beekman on Broadway really provides a good home for me. I’m not affiliated with the apartment in any way and I guarantee this is my true experience. Just pay a visit to see everything for yourself if you are still in doubt LOL!",,,,,"Hi,

The management, especially Tayler, is very kind and responsive. The pool, grilling area, patio, lobby, and gym are beautiful & well-maintained. Having covered parking on the same level as our unit is really convenient for bringing in groceries, avoiding snow/rain, etc. The little self-serve market has a good selection. It's about a 15-min walk to the hospital or to Kerrytown. Our appliances, heat, cooling, and plumbing all work perfectly and the internet is fast and reliable. Management/maintenance has been very quick to respond to the minor issues we have had. It's true that there have been some problems with early, noisy trash pickup and people setting off fire alarms - and maybe I have been less affected than some given the location of our unit - but I think management has worked out solutions within a reasonable time frame. There also used to be an issue with the trash chutes getting clogged/backed up, but I haven't run into this in quite a while. That said, it is probably not ideal to be in the unit right next to the trash chute. And yes, the construction can be loud, but is less of an issue if you get up/work before 7 anyway.

1. Their responses are faster than other housing so that the procedure is going through smoothly, and manager is kind.
2. This housing isn't close to market but close to station and University.

Bad points
1. Application fee is too expensive comparing it with other housing of 50 to 100 dollars. It's about 580 dollars but they don't refund it despite of any reasons. Although I can't go there due to the restriction of traveling to US by the ministry of foreign affairs, application fee wasn't refunded.
2. Rent cost is also too expensive comparing it with other housing.

This housing is for renting in short term.
For example, if you live in Ann Arbor for three months, this housing is better than hotel.",,,,,"Hi Knge, Thank you for your review.

Pros of the apartment
-In unit washer/dryer

-Big bathroom
-Sliding glass door
-Nice appliances (I liked the fact that the stove was gas but that's a personal preference)

Cons of the apartment
-Lots of issues with bugs; especially spiders
-No garbage disposal
-Bedroom was small and had no lighting (you will need a lamp)

Pros of the complex
-Management (especially Tayler) was very kind and helpful and maintenance fixed issues in a reasonable time frame
-The common areas seemed well maintained and the pool, deck and gym were very nice
-There is a little market in the lobby
-Controlled access to the building

Beekman seems like a luxury property at first, but that luxury is surface-level. Aside from some minor issues that could be overcome (e.g., no lighting in bedrooms, leaks in bathrooms, doors don't latch closed properly, no garbage disposals), there are some issues that I would call large. First, many units on the north side of the property get absolutely NO direct sunlight due to the orientation and design of the building, leaving them quite dark even in the middle of the day. Grass grows poorly on that side of the building and water drains slowly. When I was signing a lease, the agent extolled the amazing grassy yard I would have; upon arrival, it was actually a pit of mud. They knew this for months in advance and did not contact me to let me know. My opinion was not considered when resolving this issue. My yard and most others on the north side were all filled with crushed gravel if our grass would not grow. My dog avoids walking on this, which has been far from ideal. Finally, I've recently discovered that the humidity levels in my apartment are quite high (consistently around 75% instead of the normal 30-50%). I discovered this because all of my houseplants died and I've noticed that my carpets sometimes feel damp, so I purchased a humidity gauge (hygrometer). My impression overall has been that the property designers and office managers value image over substance.",,,,,"Hi Tiffany,

Thank you for providing feedback as a valued resident of Beekman on Broadway.  We’re so pleased to hear that you love the location of our community and can work together to address the negative aspects noted.   We strive to provide exceptional service and ensure that our service team handles all service-related concerns as they’re brought to our attention.   You mentioned you may need certain repairs made within your home, so I placed a service request to have our team inspect the areas noted within your home . We want you to love living at Beekman on Broadway, so please know that we're here for you and want to help improve your experience.

We’re truly sorry if the concerns regarding the condition of your yard upon move in affected our goal of earning your 5-star approval.  The area located on the north side of the community was an area that our team placed gravel within due to the lack of sunlight that area receives.  I apologize that this was not communicated prior but if you’re having water pooling or sitting water within your yard this may be a separate concern.  Let’s work together if this is the case and see if drain tiles may be needed.

Thank you for your feedback and let us know if there’s any way, we can better serve you.

Respectfully,

We are very sorry about the noise transmission.  The last email I received from you was April 10 which I did reply to.  As you know, we have reached out to your neighbor on several occasions.  As in any midrise multi-unit apartment building, there will be occasional noise transmission  and it is part of living in an apartment building.

Additionally the management is not very responsive, and definitely treats us differently as college students. The first three weeks we were here our dryer was broken, and despite reporting this issue multiple times, it was not handled for weeks.

Highlights: Brand new building, modern appliances, adjacent to hospital shuttle stop, solid gym, responsive management and maintenance, covered parking, nice pool/grill area, no problems with noise from adjacent apartments

Considerations: Pricey, no kitchen sink garbage disposals (asked management and they said they are unable to install), no concierge to handle packages, cheap-feeling cabinets, unsightly, narrow hallways, covered parking pass is expensive (cheaper to buy hospital parking at adjacent lot or, better yet, use street parking), online payment system not user friendly, lot directly south of building under construction soon, dumpsters south of building unsightly

Thank you so much for your positive highlights of our community and also for your suggestions on how we can improve. Our team will be so happy to hear that their friendly service has made such a difference, and we'll be sure the new team hears your specific praise!  We do have our team working on organizing the package closet and and have asked all vendors to ensure to place all packages within our secured package closet.  Since we have a camera system in place within this package room we don't have a need for the concierge on staff.  We're looking into a new package system for this specific location; however the vendor service that we've reached out to does not have a warehouse within the Ann Arbor area but will have a warehouse added within 2022.  This will be a game changer for us and our residents.  We look forward to adding a new package system in place at Beekman on Broadway in the near future if this pans out.

We'd love to earn a few more stars from you, so if there are any concerns you have that are affecting your satisfaction, will you please let us know? We'd love to connect either in the office or at via email.

Stop hiding my reviews and stifling me. I just want people to know the TRUTH! I am not sharing fake information. If you or your friends are  looking for an apartment, PLEASE PLEASE share it with your friends, colleagues and classmates before Beenman does its little trick to let google to hide my post.

1. Beekman is intentionally pending my post on their website so the residents can't see what I am saying. Their website is a joke. They are not willing to communicate.
2. As you can see from other reviews, there is a HUGE issue going on that Beekman is pretending not to see. There is a construction outside where the same company that runs Beekman, Morningside,  is building a second apartment. The construction starts around 7am everyday in the morning and it is super lound. Half of the building (south facing side) is doomed and not livable at all. It will at least last for how hong it will usally take to finish a building.
3. Besides that you can also see from other reviews that the trash vendor is collecting trash 6:30 in the morning. Yes Beekman did manage to push it back for like what, a month. They they started to come really early in the morning again.
4. This building has lots of other problems. Given the high rent there is no garbage disposal in the kitchen. And as you can see from the picture, the rooms next to the fire valve cabinet make weird noise at night. You can hear the sound of pumps and it was unbearable.

What is more important the Beekman is using stifling strategy to remove as many negative reviews as possible. They are never willing to solve the problem. They never contacted me even once after three postes I had on their website. I don't have anyting to say about Beenkman at this point. I am so disappointed. There are tons of good options in Ann Arbor I guess if you are a student or employee who just needs to get some good rest.",https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO4KwlBrmrXqDuu63lstkaD92sMHreNiOkynQT5,"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO4KwlBrmrXqDuu63lstkaD92sMHreNiOkynQT5, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOd7bEo7QjurMMHYZSJgfFeVo-ACAS6KgV4cW6j, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMi-puCPcfxih8iYeWrU-XUlm7SKykmlkmiXmJ5",,"AF1QipO4KwlBrmrXqDuu63lstkaD92sMHreNiOkynQT5, AF1QipOd7bEo7QjurMMHYZSJgfFeVo-ACAS6KgV4cW6j, AF1QipMi-puCPcfxih8iYeWrU-XUlm7SKykmlkmiXmJ5",Thank you Jerry for your review.

They give a 20$ gift card to residents who put a 5 star review on google to spend on the buildings self-service mini market. I know that because I was a resident there. This used to be a 5 star review, but since I'm no longer there, I decided to edit it and be honest. I would give beekman 4 stars. These are the reasons why:
Pros - It only takes a 20-25 minute walk to go to central campus, there is a bus stop right in front of the building that takes you to the supermarket and to campus, the facilities are amazing (package room, gym, pool, media room, places to study, really good maintainance, parking...).
Cons - It is expensive as f***, and you will pay an extra fee if you don't have a us account and have to pay by card (exchange students be aware of this), plus they also charge you a profesional carpet cleaning fee when you leave, regardless of whether your carpet is clean or not.

Conclusion: it is good value for money if you make absolute use of all the facilities and services, because if not you will feel like you're overpaying a lot.

They are very vocal and have no issues singing their songs. I highly recommend experiencing life at Ann Arbor Woods!!",,,,,"Thank you for taking a moment to review Ann Arbor Woods!

Really odd, eerie sounds from the pipes at night when the heat is on. My shower would run ice cold if the folks above me turned their water on. The washing machines would always clog and overflow gross grey water from the sinks, and the maintenance solution was to cut a hole in the floor so it would drain. Honestly, the nicest part of this apartment complex is the leasing office. Very clear where they're putting their money. I didn't renew my lease because the price was going up by almost $400. When I asked why, they said it was to cover the cost of renovating units-- bear in mind, I lived in a renovated unit. The landlords are trying to make their tenants pay for improvements in units that they don't live in-- kind of seems like WE are providing THEM with housing, not the other way around.

Since I believe it's helpful to end on a good note, I'll start with the issues. The complex is very old, having been made in the 60s. Many of the units have not been refurbished and there are things that will not be fixed or replaced without an entire tear down, meaning not while you're living there. Many of the units are not wheelchair accessible, and the only covered parking is far away from most of the units.

To be fair and balanced, however, you have a number of advantages. For one, it's reasonably priced for the area and highly accessible to a number of places, including the university. There's an absolutely gorgeous park next door and several others a short drive away. The staff at the leasing office is very helpful and the maintenance staff are very prompt with requests. It's very dog-friendly, too, and your pup will have a lot of friends to get together with.

The leasing office and staff are always condescending and extremely unhelpful. The maintenance man drives his golf cart around every day chain smoking and leaving his cigarette butts all over the premises. When you submit a work order, he does the least to fix it and always acts like it’s not his responsibility. A blade from the ceiling fan shot out of the fan one day due to not being installed correctly and could’ve injured ourselves, our animals, or our belongings. When maintenance finally came to investigate, he said “just don’t turn it on high” (which it wasn’t when this happened).
Most recently, we reported numerous mice in our unit, to which the staff were not at all empathetic, validating, or helpful. Instead, we were told there’s “nothing they can do” except have pest control stop by when they routinely come to the premises 2x a month. Meaning we would have to wait another week until getting the chance of help for having literal rodents living in our home.

The buildings themselves are old, dirty, and decrepit. It seems every possible corner has been cut to save them a dime. For example, the laminate flooring that resembles wood is literally peel and stick wallpaper. Some complexes take pride in the environment they offer, and this is clearly not one of them.",,,,,"Hi, Tim. We're sorry to see this review.

You can't beat the location of this place either, being so close to Trader Joe's and all of the shopping on Washtenaw, the AATA bus line being so close, and it's proximity to downtown. It's also a great place to get some retreat from the business of downtown so you can get some peace and quiet in your home.

The maintenance team is another highlight of this community. Even at the height of the worker shortages during COVID, Roger and his team hustled to ensure the community was kept up, and worked excessive hours to stay on top of work orders. They are extremely friendly too.

Here are some of the pros and cons I found about living here:

Pros:
1. Location - Close to downtown (1.5 miles) and close to stores/shopping on Washtenaw. Also had public transit right on Medford Road.
2. Maintenance was usually pretty timely to respond to concerns and fixed them properly.
3. Office staff was always available and very friendly/helpful when I went in.
4. Even though the washer/dryer was a shared basement unit, I never had issues doing laundry.

Cons:
1. The apartments are VERY old for the price you pay. Rent went up as I was leaving, and even though I left for work reasons, it would have been hard to pay their asking price for the age and condition of the apartments.

2. With apartment age comes a lot of minor annoyances that you should be prepared to deal with.

3. Winter grounds maintenance could be better. The parking lot was often left unplowed after snow storms.

4. Baseboard heat did not work very well or properly and the pipes in the basement vibrated and squeaked below my unit.

Overall, I would recommend these apartments to a friend. They could really stand to be updated if the prices continue to increase, but all in all a good place to rent.",,,,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBaHZLUFB3EAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x8e767a98aa77667a!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICAhvKPPw%7CCgwIl76a0wUQwMHJjgE%7C?hl=en-US,3,1516674839,01/23/2018 02:33:59,3,-8181216876958357894,30,6,2,10,36

By the end of my time there, I was very disappointed by the turn for the worst that the complex had taken under the new management company.
The apartment itself was fine. Nice space, but needed updates and renovations badly. Definitely liveable, and neighbors were nice.

Upon moving out we did realize there was some sort of rodent problem from the holes in the baseboard heating system and the outside facing walls.

It seems like all of the management’s focus was on persuading new tenants to move in. Hayman made many cheap attempts at luring people to sign leases for “luxury apartment living”, but their ploys only left current tenants to deal with increased rent, new services we didn’t ask for (but had to pay for), paying for utilities, and unnecessary updates while ignoring what really needs updating.
They rolled out a “reserved parking” plan where tenants could pay extra for the few closest spots to their apartment building, but new tenants didn’t realize that those spots were once free!  Seriously, I was not going to pay extra each month for “reserved parking” when I was able to park there for free before!
The maintenance and upkeep I saw during my time there under Hayman’s management were not impressive. The lawn and landscaping schedule was pushed from Wednesday mornings to Saturdays, so we were woken up early every weekend to the loud motors of mowers and blowers because the truck made its permenant parking space right outside our apartment.
As we were moving out, there were some coats of paint sloppily slapped on the walls of our building’s hallway. In the warmer months, trash sat on the grass for multiple days in a row before someone came to pick it up.
I really enjoyed all the perks of living at Ann Arbor Woods in the beginning. And I do agree that it is a fabulous location (right behind Trader Joe’s, easy access to downtown and Washtenaw) but I was very disappointed in the quality of management that came with the shift in ownership.",,,,,"Thank you for your detailed review, Caitlin.

Since they've taken over, my rent has gone up about $300/month. My one bedroom apartment, (that is by no means ""luxury""), is about $1300/month now. Nothing is included, and there’s really no amenities whatsoever.

In addition to rent increases, they stated charging for water, gas, pest removal, some sewer fee, storm drain fee, of course some kind of really important admin fee, and they've enforced a mandatory $25/month garbage removal fee where everyone has a trash can that sits and stinks in the hallway and an outside company comes and picks it up. Cool, if you're handicap or elderly, but not for the majority of residents who are 20-30 year olds and have working legs and live on a fixed income. Most people don't even seem to use it. So it's just wasted money for a company that they probably have some sort of deal with. Might be a nice option to have people voluntarily OPT in for. Aside from the unnecessary trash can thing, all of the other charges were already included in my previous rent amount before Hayman. I could *maybe* understand starting to charge for the monthly utilities but NOT jacking the rent up as well. They obviously don't care about the interests of the residents here.

They've taken away at least 15-20 parking spots. We already had covered parking spots available to rent out, but now there's several ""reserved"" UNCOVERED spots that you have to pay for. No one pays for them because it's stupid. Even tho no one seems to be paying for/using them, they're still there months later so now we just have that many less spots to park in.

I'm sure part of the huge rent increase has gone to gutting and re-doing the leasing office, tho! Now the leasing office looks like the entry-way of a tanning salon. So glad I'm contributing to that.

They also redid the landscaping by tearing up the grass and putting a bunch of rocks and boulders. Nice?

On top of all this, every person I've dealt with in the leasing office has been extremely short and rude. Absolutely zero knowledge/sense of customer service. When I've called/visited them to inquire about anything, (like my maintenance request that has gone un-acknowledged for weeks) instead of them maybe apologizing and finding a way to resolve the issue, I've gotten attitude as if I'm in the wrong, or like I'm imposing on them somehow. I'm sure working in an environment like that can be annoying sometimes because you're dealing with the sometimes unhappy resident, but I think they need to realize that that's literally their job. To help. When you make 100 dumb, mandatory changes to people's living environment (many of whom have lived here for 5+ years), they're going to probably be a little disgruntled about some of them.

The maintenance guys seem nice, when I happen to see/hear from them. Maintenance requests can go weeks without any acknowledgement. The only way to get a response is by reaching out to the office 5+ times AFTER submitting an online request.

Want happy residents?

1. Don't jack their rent up and give them useless ""updates"" as a return. The new door numbers now look like cheesy clip-art that should be on a kindergarten classroom door. The old ones were 100% fine.
2. Just be somewhat friendly/nice/understanding to your residents. Ask them what they want before making expensive changes that nobody wants.

And that's it.

Having one free hotdog party a year as some kind of ""resident appreciation"" doesn't make up for rude staff members or your extreme pricing increases.",,,,,We are sad to see you have not enjoyed your home at Ann Arbor Woods.

I had previously shared a review expressing how much I enjoyed living here, but that was when the property was still owned by Slavik Management. Since the Hayman Company has arrived, things have taken a turn for the worse. Tiffany, the manager is extremely rude, and for someone who has to deal with tenants on a daily basis has absolutely no idea how to engage in conversation in a respectful manner. The first time I had to deal with her was when I had to renew my lease. She refused to show me a copy of the lease, unless I agreed to sign on it. When I protested about the sudden hike in rent, she even went so far as to say ""You can leave today, tomorrow i'll have the apartment rented out."" Needless to say, with this attitude, the parking lots are now visibly empty and there are several vacant apartments where some tenants had been living for decades. My advice is to take the negative reviews about this community very seriously when considering to rent an apartment here. There is no doubt the location is great, access to Trader Joes is a bonus. However, dealing with the management is such a pain in the neck. Google maps doesn't allow a review without a single star at minimum, but frankly the Hayman Company doesn't deserve that either.

Update (2/22/19): there used to be a contracted weekly cleaning service that would vacuum the common areas of all the buildings. Hayman says there is someone who comes in weekly, but claim it is not at a fixed day or time of the week. Essentially another way to deny that there is a regular cleaning service. The common areas are filthy and despite multiple complaints over a period of two weeks, no one has bothered to clean up.

Here are the pros and cons from my perspective.

PROS:
-It is an inexpensive, yet fully renovated unit. I haven't been able to find any renovated 2 bedroom apartment at a price even nearly as close as the one I am paying here. The apartment is completely renovated - from the floorboards and bathroom tiles, to kitchen appliances and cupboards; it looks and feels absolutely great. This is a huge plus, given how high the rent in Ann Arbor is.
- With the odd party, it has been fairly quiet during the night, so one is able to rest (not so quiet during the day, though)
- It is relatively close to campus (about a 15-minute bike ride, 20-25 minutes on the bus, which is comparable to Woodbury Gardens where I used to rent for 4 years prior to moving here).
- The proximity of the nearby public park is great if you have a pet.
- They do have a quick and responsive maintenance
- It is pet friendly.

CONS
-The biggest issue: my unit is above the laundry room and there's a non-stop ambient noise; in addition, you can feel strong smell of detergent if the window is open. The noise can only be heard in the living room but it bad enough for me to need to watch TV using headphones. This was NOT made clear when I decided to rent here. Had it been made clear, I would not have chosen the unit I am currently renting.
-It is definitely not as quiet as my previous rental community, Woodbury Gardens. AA Woods is a lot cheaper, though - the rent is $700 lower, so this is expected as you get a different type of tenant/neighbour, in particular, many more undergraduate students vs. professionals compared to my previous community.
-Unlike Woodbury Gardens and The Ponds at Georgetown, Ann Arbor Woods does not provide ANY dog amenities, despite charging the same - $30 fee. There are no dog waste stations, dog waste bags or a dog park. So you feel you are being charged a pet fee without anything provided for your pet. I do not mind too much, though, since the rent is very low considering what you are getting.",,,,,"Thank you for these kind words about our community at Ann Arbor Woods!

It’s extremely frustrating when you pay so much to live somewhere and you don’t get the proper service you deserve. Maintenance request take months to get taken care of and maybe even longer sometimes they just mark the request complete and you have to start all over and put in a new request which extends the wait time even longer. There’s request that I put in last year that have yet to be taken care of. I just thing there’s room for improvement not satisfied.

I put in a request for my dish washer to be fixed due to some pieces breaking off. This has not been fixed as of yet. I've been told for months that the piece has to be ordered. Before you know it it'll be time for me to sign a new lease...  On a positive note the people in the office are nice and way much more professional than the old group of staff, however, there's always room for improvement as I said above. Little things such as making sure lights at each door entrance are probably working for safety purposes. honestly just speaking for myself as a young adult living on my own I don't feel comfortable walking into my home in the dark. The door entrance lights have not been working since i moved in that was a year ago. I put in a request for this to be fixed several times not just for my safety but for everyone who's living there. I think that its important that  we feel at home wherever you live. things are slowly improving but could be better.

They took over last summer, 2018, and are flipping the place.  I received an informal note on my door stating I would need to reapply.  When I went to inquire, the staff that Hayman originally had in place were very confused, and answers were vague.  It was at that point  I learned of the hefty  increase in rent to come. Nothing formal in writing was ever sent stating what the rent would be, nor what month to month would be if one didn't sign a new lease. I couldn't get a straight answer. They've since sent in  a second set of staff.  I've talked to two of the three and they were both very rude, and simply unpleasant to deal with. Appears to be a scam tactic and on purpose to drive current residents out.  I only just learned today, 3/24/2019,  that they will now be charging for ""all utilities"" when I dared to go talk with staff to inquire about status of uncompleted maintenance requests. They could not answer how they will determine what renters will pay.
This is the trend of course for places where the economy is good. Big companies come in, buy out complexes, and jack up the rents. Unfortunately, A2 is at this point. The way it works, but the unethical way in which Hayman is going about it is very bothersome.
I've lived here for close to twenty years. AAWs is one of the oldest, still existing complexes in A2.  It is a fantastic location.  However, the buildings are falling apart due to age.  There are constant maintenance issues and it's not unusual to see maintenance folks scampering around loudly.  Out of fairness to the last management, Slavik, there was an honest attempt to try to fix up the place. They started remodeling kitchens and some bathrooms as residents moved out. They also fixed balconies, and did some repairs on concrete, and re-landscaped the place. This increased effort started  about five years ago after city inspectors started coming through.  The maintenance staff took notes for every apartment a few weeks prior regarding what needed to be fixed. They said they'd do it soon, but the inspectors must not have scheduled my place, as those repairs never took place.
Hayman's claim is that they will be upgrading the apartments. All I've really seen is new  paint slapped on the walls sloppily by shoddy workers. Much of what you see  now was done by Slavik.  I've seen no real attention paid to more major problems such as leaky plumbing, and heat problems. Maintenance of snow and ice this past winter was poor.  For my place alone, my ceiling has been damaged three times due to leaking plumbing from above.  My heat has never worked correctly, my A/C pre-dates my move in, there is a spot on one wall that is crumbling, and the glaze on my tub has worn thin in one spot. All reported, all ignored.
I've put up with all of this as the rent was well below other apartments. There were also many middle aged long term tenants here and it was a very friendly, nice community.  Most have left  as they learned of rent increase, utilities, and increased noise level by inconsiderate workers.
I hope I'm wrong, and that Hayman will actually fix this place up big time, but all it is now is sloppily done cosmetic for looks things.  In my opinion what this place really needs is a total gutting, or a tear down and rebuild. You can do better for the amount of money Hayman wants, and believe me, you won't want to deal with the staff after you move in.
Could be the staff are simply burnt out already, as that has been the trend here.  Staff never have stayed long, probably due to abnormally large amount of maintenance requests and upkeep. There are nicer places to work without the headaches. I wish them well and hope they can be nicer, more honest,  in the future. You'd think Hayman Company would have sent in staff that know how to do it right. As for me, time to follow the lead of others and leave. I can find better for what I've heard the price  will be from others. Note too, one of few positive reviews is by the current leasing agent.

Where do I start? First off all, the rents are a solid rate and you really do get what you pay for. The apartment buildings are all well built and within the room you get plenty of space to manage your living. Second of all, there are plenty of trees as well as sidewalks to get some running/walking/jogging done. Third, it is close to major bus routes in addition to downtown Ann Arbor. Fourth, the maintenance department takes care of problems in the apartments very well. I find it very convenient to access grocery stores, church, and major shops from here.

I live alone in a 1B1B on the 2nd floor in a motel style building near the leasing office.

Good things I have to say about Ann Arbor woods is that near work, the bus stops near by are convenient for getting to work (I have to pay for parking to go to work so taking the bus for free using my employee ID is great), and apparently the rent ($995 for rent alone and other charges making a total of around $1000-$1100 a month) I pay is considered ""cheap"" for Ann Arbor. There's trash removal right in front of my door so I don't have to go all the way down to throw out my trash which is nice.

I was spoiled I guess because the apartment I lived in before was half the rent cheaper and came fully furnished with a in-unit washer and dryer which I can understand because Ann Arbor is a more expensive place to live in but for the price I pay, I expected my apartment here to be...better.

PLEASE READ

Some bad things about my experience here so far since moving in only 6 months ago...

The motel style building I live in can be bothersome. There is a walk-way right in front of my 2 large windows in my bed room and living room which makes it difficult to have my blinds open to have natural light when people can walk by and see what I'm doing in my apartment so I feel like I have no privacy. I will ask for a different building when my lease comes to a near end probably.

When I first moved in, the apartment was HOT. I moved in near the beginning of summer but it was still somewhat cold where I didn't need to turn on the AC but I did. I was told by maintenance after making about 2 or 3 complaints about it that there is a pipe that runs through my unit that causes the heat and that they'v known about it for a while but haven't done anything about it. With my complaint, I was asked ""did you try turning on the AC?"" I don't want to waste energy doing that when it's still cool outside but the heat is coming from my building.

The AC unit is only in the living room.

There's no thermostat in my apartment so I never know what the temp in my unit is.

The blades for the blinds in the living room don't match each other and they break easily from me turning them only a few times since moving in (I don't turn them often since because of above mentioned privacy issue). Since they are different lengths and widths, the blades run into each other and don't turn so they get stuck and break...

My bedroom door frame is wonky so when it's closed there's a noticeable gap.

There's no counter space in the bathroom and the toilet paper thing is placed in a bad place where it's difficult to reach and near the corner of the sink so when the sink gets wet, water drips off and onto the toilet paper.

I'm paying for ""pest control"" or whatever but I've never lived in an apartment where I found this many bugs. My old apartment didn't have a bug problem like I've noticed here. HUGE BUGS and I've noticed my apartment is prone to fruit flies. Never had a problem like this before anywhere else I lived.

There have been times where I've tried to visit the leasing office to try and speak to someone about these issues but even during business hours, the office would be locked with no one inside so it seems difficult to get a hold on someone.

These might sound like small things but if I'm paying $1000-ish I should have some of this not be a problem.",,,,,"Thank you for taking time to offer us a review, Lynn.

In short: really nice location, outdated but decently well-maintained buildings, terrible owners, disorganized leasing office, overpriced. This used to be a nice place to live and a good value, but after the change of ownership in summer of 2018 that went right out the window.

Since I know this review will get a canned reply from Hayman Company, here's how they can improve: Lower rents back to something in line with what they were before you jacked them up. Start checking and responding to your office voicemails. Remove the special ""privileged"" parking spots that almost nobody is signing up to pay for. Make the ""valet"" trash service optional, so residents don't get charged for a service they never asked for. Add some amenities or improvements, since you've chosen to increase costs in every possible way.",,,,,"Thank you for taking a moment to share this feedback with us.

They took my security deposit against their own wordings.

I honestly don't know where to begin, there are a number of recent reviews that will cover it enough. Please take the negative reviews very seriously as they are 100% accurate. I lived here over 5 years and had to sadly depart due to the inability of the office staff to give me a correct version of the lease and be able to explain it (no one wanted to go over it - probably because they had to admit that the complex was no longer paying for water [aka baseboard heat] and was now charging residents for a mandatory $25 ""valet trash service"" and pest control). The office actually couldn't tell me how they were going to be charging for water - they said that I'd ""get a bill in the mail from DTE"". Hmm. Water comes from the city, and is usually either a flat rate or split across the building. This is just one example of their ineptitude. It's a real shame because this is a fantastic location, even though the parking lot is small and the apartments are incredibly dated (they're updating some of them now, but they're nowhere near worth the cost of rent!). The final straw was when I asked for my original, 1970's wall unit AC to be replaced with a newer version like they have in the leasing office and they said no. I signed my lease termination papers that day. Good riddance!

The office staff is so bad, one time they responded to a question I sent in email with a PDF they scanned of another resident's personal court order for child custody. It was insane that they would flippantly send me a private document! Also, they'd constantly have issues with their online rent payment (mandatory- they were no longer accepting ANY other form of payment) and residents were constantly receiving COURT ORDERS for payment in the mail - even if their rent was already paid well in advance.",,,,,"Though it is disheartening to read that your experience with our community has not been as positive as we would hope, we appreciate you bringing your concerns to our attention.

One week was not sufficient time for both notice and compliance. The notice also did not specify how and where to get tags. Tried to contact manager regarding our concerns about this, and concerns for the style of bike tags, and there was no room for discussion and not all of my concerns were not addressed. Locks were cut and our bikes were taken.

Went to Ann Arbor Woods Office to talk about my concerns with the new policy and how it was executed. I was given the information to contact Slavik Management.

Called Slavik Management five times and left three voicemails. They did not call me back for five days. Once they did, we had already made our decision to leave the community.

I met with property manager, Mary Ellen Hartigan, which resulted in the decision to leave. During this meeting, Hartigan told me she did not address my concerns from my e-mails because ""I sounded like I wanted to be the owner"" and that she only needed to give me ""24 hours notice to take my property"". She also was very condescending about the bike tags and even started to tell me how I was ""really"" feeling when I tried to explain to her how this incident, and how it was being handled, was affecting me. I left the meeting in tears and felt very unheard.

Don’t look here. Run!

If you’re looking for a new place. This is NOT the one.

The day we moved out, there were another 6 people moving out because the rents increases year on year were very high. One of the other longer term tenants told me that renting a whole house down the street was much cheaper than her studio here.

It’s very noisy. You can hear your (quietist) neighbors speak, walk, even fart!

Power/electric issue. Losing power “every other month” (6 times+ a year) for days is not fun! All my food spoils. Elevators do not work. I have had to check in a hotel. The George Apartments needs a backup generator! It’s not livable.

Package delivery is a mess. Their system doesn’t work. Often, the delivery boxes are not used because the boxes may be too small, or because the delivery driver didn’t feel like it. It can take 30 mins to find a package in the mess.

Over the years, maintenance requests have gotten better; with Moe and his crew doing a great job. The one star would be for them.

Now, the management team is horrendous! Over the past few months, they’ve been trying to squeeze out every little penny from their tenants (and non-tenants) by adding JUNK fees for literally everything- from water to outside parking to using common spaces.

When we moved out, the management still hasn’t refunded our deposit. They made up some fake fees and charges. Michigan law details pretty specific requirements for return of your deposit. If you don’t follow that, you’re stuck. Luckily we are familiar. But still waiting for a refund, and it’s likely we would need to drag them to court for the security deposit.

Update: management refunded our deposit.",,,,,"George, we're very sorry to see this review.

Management- The Management company is OK. Kinda hard to get anyone to do anything. Requests are ignored, and probably forgotten. The gentleman in charge of the cleaning crew is really nice, but I wish it was easier to find him.

Trash rooms- are overflowing, and not cleaned out regularly.

Deliveries/Packages- often disappear. You really need to sign up for the package concierge, but that service is spotty.

Rent increases- The rents have gone up quite a lot, and continue to increase by 20-40% most years, it seems from my experience, and reading reviews here on google.

Extra fees- There are a lot of ""add on"" fees, which is not typical for rental units. Trash fees, water fees, fees for more than one person living on the premises, covered parking fees, garage parking fees; and now, new fees to use amenities, for example, Lounge/Kitchen area use will cost $100.00 each time!",,,,,"Hi, Saba.

I'm having a difficult time contacting someone about the trash being piled up to the ceiling because management seems to be firing people left and right so much so that I don't even know if there is maintenance here.

This morning I was woken up at 3am and kept up for hours by the fire alarm system falsely going off with no one to fix it or address the issue. I also noticed a company this morning arriving with water for the sprinkler system and now even question if there is enough water in the sprinklers for a real emergency? Living in the George has been one disaster after the other, with each taking months on end of complaining to address, just for something else to go wrong right after.

The apartment units themself aren't bad, and the appliances are nice, when they actually work. However...

The management of the building is totally unprofessional and disrespectful

When you put in maintenance tickets, you have to track them down for weeks to get them to do anything about them

They added random charges this month to our rent because they didn't have their payment system set up correctly the last two months to add 'convenience fees' when paying by a credit card, so they decided to retroactively add them

There's one maintenance guy for the ENTIRE BUILDING (200+ units)

The fire alarms go off at all hours making the entire building evacuate

They recently converted free outdoor parking spots into $50 a month spots

When we moved in, they promised they would add stores to the bottom level. After three years these are still vacant, and now they're trying to lobby the city to turn them into individual units

If they spent half as much time maintaining the building as they do replying to the myriad negative reviews here, it actually might be a decent place to live, but as of right now...

We are in the newest wing and have a great apartment with lots of light, and the apartments are well designed and appointed with a great kitchen and laundry plus LOTS of storage space.  The common amenities are also superb.  The swimming pool and kitchen/lounge seem great,, although we haven't used them much.

Kara and her colleagues repeatedly solved issues for us and for others as they have been opening up new floors and leasing out the building.  Yes, there have been a few alarms which were annoying, but it's a new building so these sorts of issues are somewhat expected.

We looked at many buildings in Ann Arbor for our small family and found that there was no other building that offered anything close to the quality, space and amenities of The George, so the price seemed fair to us.

The amenities were good, the doors were always locked so it was very safe and we loved our apartment. I’m leaving this review not to complain about the building, but about the office and the people who work there. The ladies who worked at the office were constantly rude to my roommates and I and never seemed to care when we had an issue. When I had a package stolen and asked for the security cameras to be checked, one lady told me she was out of office and the other simply said this was disappointing behavior. After moving out, I’ve been trying for over two months to retrieve a package that was left there and have gotten absolutely no help- they either tell me it’s not their responsibility or simply don’t reply to my emails. These are only two of the instances where the office showed they could not care less about the residents. Very disappointing",,,,,Hello.

New management is much better!

Original post:
Horrible management. Moved here last year. Recent change management has been atrocious.
Trash rooms have been down for more than a month. There is trash around the building.
Air condition doesn’t work. Maintenance hates dealing with management, there is change in maintenance almost every 2-3 months.

Apartments are built nice and fellow residents are kind but that’s about it.
Management really needs to step up if they want to charge luxury apartment rent, they need to keep maintained as such.",,,,,"Thank you for your review of The George, Steve.

While the amenities are great (Beautiful pool, gym, communal kitchen area, etc) the quality of the apartments is lacking. To give the building staff some credit some of the issues I experienced when I first moved in have been resolved (fuses blowing every day) but the construction of the building is just not worth the rental prices.

I live on the third floor and I can hear the people walk around above me, I can hear the people in the apartment next to me when they watch tv or have an argument, and when I attempted to move apartments when i first moved in after discovering this I was told I would have to pay an ""application fee"" in order to move into another unit..... also I was told that after having gone a month having active discussions on the process and also touring new units in the building which was frustrating.

While I do think this complex has potential I truly don't think its worth the prices. For paying almost 2k a month I expect it to be spotless, high quality, and while everything may not be in a working order since its new I would expect prompt response in fixing it. Instead I have an apartment with terrible water pressure (showers don't get very hot and have terrible pressure) where I can hear my neighbors every move, in a complex that charges for certain community events AFTER I pay 2k a month ....

We appreciate your feedback. Construction of the apartments was completed earlier this year and we are in the process of filling the apartment homes and are currently more than half full.

I’ve lived through no less than three different property management firms. I think I’ve earned the right to an opinion.

I’ve changed my ratings for the property from a “1” to a “3” and now a “5”. I’ll be blunt, The George is not cheap. My expectations are set accordingly. My main concerns have been management of the common areas such as the pool and landscaping, the mail system and trash. Further, for the money, I’ve been astonished at how little has been done to make me feel like a customer (ie a privilege) vs an anonymous face (a necessary endurance required to collect rent). It’s a pity. The property itself is extremely nice. New lofts are going in. I’d argue it should be a contender for the top spot in A2. However, those common services were / are designed woefully under capacity for the 249 apartments here. The property management companies have historically expected the maintenance team (a whopping 2 people) to muscle through the capacity problems manually, but even at 70 hour weeks, the problem(s) is(are) too big. That’s where the new community manager comes into play.

I feel a wee bit guilty, but I cornered the new community manager for some “coaching” several weeks back. Poor thing, it was about 45 minutes of it. I’d say she took it professionally and empathetically. She was attentive. Solid customer management skills. She made several promises to improve the situation. In return, I agreed to a clean slate review here if, and only if, I saw positive change brewing. Well, I have and hence have penned this review. I’m optimistic the changes I’m seeing will make a difference. I’m particularly delighted with the scrutiny around the mail system. Specifically, holding the carriers accountable. That’s been a real thorn in everyone’s heel. Communications from the community management office are improving (some of the prior communications were just embarrassing). Little things like trash pickup are improving. And so on, but that noise makes a big difference to the tenants. The guys paying the bills.

Is everything suddenly resolved and humming along? No. There’s much to be done. My “5” rating is as much about renewed confidence as it is about sustained change. Every community will have its challenges. Full stop. It’s how those challenges are tackled that counts. It’s my confidence in the new team, + guys like Moe (maintenance leader) who’s been around a few years like me, that are behind my “5”.

Now, if only we could arrange a Korean taco truck…………..",,,,,"Michael, we're sorry you've been having frustrations during your time with us.
