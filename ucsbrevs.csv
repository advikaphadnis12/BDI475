My child and his friend decided to explore new living arrangements.  Had they chosen to renew, Solis IV made the process simple.   Ava Feiz is a consummate professional who is prompt and helpful.  When various issues and questions arose during the year, Ava was responsive, patient and thorough with her follow-ups and communication. She can reassure the most anxious of parents.

First review:
To second another reviewer, it is the people that make a company. I can’t speak more highly of Ava, the property manager. From the outset, she was professional, personable, and helpful from promptly following up on communications to answering my extensive questions over the phone. Just inked the lease and the move-in is not until summer 2022, so don’t yet have any experience with living on the property. Looking forward to writing a follow-up review on the property.",,,,,"Thank you so much for your kind words and great review, we are excited for a great year as well!

I pay $3700 for small one bedroom apartment with extremely old washer and dryer models. A few weeks ago I came home and found an enormous amount of ants all over my apartment. I submitted a service request. 3 days later!!!! someone came to spray my apartment, so literally, I had to have ants crawling on me while I was sleeping for 3 days!! Today I woke up and found thousands of ants in my apartment again!! I called to the leasing office in the morning and they explained to me that it is because of the weather change and sent  ME to the store to buy spray and get rid of the ants in the apartment I’m paying almost 4k for. They told me the earliest day someone can come is next Wednesday, so if I don’t want to wait I have to solve this problem by myself. Just think about it. I have to live with ants for the whole week or I have to spend my money and time and learn skills how to basically be a pest control. Btw I am not talking about a few ants. I have literally thousands of them all over my place. And let’s not forget that they can bite and spread diseases. So, do not live in this apartment complex. I experienced one of the worst, health threatening experiences here. And please see the pictures. Also I have 2 dogs and as you can see ants are inside of my dogs’ bowls all over their food. So I have to throw away $100 bag of dog food and food from all my kitchen cabinets, and, once again, I have to go to the store, spend money on chemicals and spray my apartment….",https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNe0L-fJuK6dhKpmtseIPVQWKqRUU_nyqANUDDt,"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNe0L-fJuK6dhKpmtseIPVQWKqRUU_nyqANUDDt, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM1wisj___XhRxpBwFE35UhMDtrrwlAE2lgfTRr, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOVm_NL9E4FasbB_x-jQUxhPM65-z4WTL3ksB6W",,"AF1QipNe0L-fJuK6dhKpmtseIPVQWKqRUU_nyqANUDDt, AF1QipM1wisj___XhRxpBwFE35UhMDtrrwlAE2lgfTRr, AF1QipOVm_NL9E4FasbB_x-jQUxhPM65-z4WTL3ksB6W","Thank you for bringing this issue to our attention, Katerina.

I’ve been checking my email, voicemail, snail mail and bank account…. I haven’t received any sort of reimbursement or direct communication from you that I’m aware of. Please let me know if you’ll actually be issuing a reimbursement.
Thanks,
Caroline

Warning about move-out/cleaning fees: I lived here for 1 year and kept the apartment in perfect condition. Before moving out I deep cleaned the apartment checking off every item on the suggested cleaning list to try and avoid being charged a cleaning fee. I left the apartment cleaner than I received it. I was charged $600+ for unit cleaning + carpet cleaning + painting. I wanted clarification on the charge and exactly what they believed was dirty. I spent weeks being bounced around on the phone between Hollister/Lyon Living/Central Billing. They could NOT provide an itemized list of what was dirty and required a full unit cleaning.

I finally gave up and paid the $674 cleaning bill because I can’t deal with them anymore.

Very disappointed with the move-out cleaning bill experience.",,,,,"Hi, Caroline. We are sorry to see that your living experience has resulted in a negative assessment of our community. After further review, we have decided to discount the cleaning due to the inconvenience caused. We will also send an updated final account statement.

He is very polite on the phone, gives you all the information you need and the thing I love the most is that he listens. This kind of customer service will set Hollister Village apart from all other places, not to mention the beautiful property. Thank you again Bobbie for all your help! I'd highly recommend this place and Bobbie to work with. He will exceed your expectations!",,,,,"Neza, thank you so much for your review! We appreciate the 5-star rating!

There is a lot of storage (hall closet, pantry, walk-in closet in bedroom, patio closet), the appliances are stainless steel and look great.  They have the lights that hang down over the bar and many of the lights are adjustable.  They have fans that are also adjustable using the light switch on the wall.  The bathtub is deep.  I have had no issues so I have had no reason to contact management so I am not sure about their response rate.  I use the gym (which is small, but has everything you need), the pool , and the spa.  There is a large space with a bar where you can cook and have parties and I have seen some people doing just that.  It is pretty quiet all the time, but you can hear the train on occasion when it goes past.  They have free electric vehicle charging and assigned parking with plenty of additional parking for guests.  I have never struggled to find a spot.  The only downside is that it is very expensive and there is no central air conditioning, only heat!  It has gotten up to 80 degrees indoors this summer and we have not made it to the hottest month of the year yet.

My name is Rod and I am the Property Director here at Hollister Village. I would love to have a meeting with you to see if there is anything I can do to help J I would like to review the work orders that you’ve called in and also check what was or wasn’t done to resolve your service request. I’d also like to review how fast the Resident Services Team responded. If there is a problem with barking dogs, I can gladly address that as well. 90% of the homes and apartments in this area do not have A/C because we are so close to the ocean, not to mention we do not advertise that we have A/C.  Our thermostats have the capability to do both heating and cooling, however there are no A/C’s connected for that feature to work. Again, we are here to help and I would really like the opportunity to discuss these concerns with you. We have a few Morgan’s in our system and I was not able to discern which entry was you and what your contact information. Please reach out to me at hollistervillage@lyonliving.com or at 805-284-9615 so that we can touchbase.

The management is THE WORST you will find in any sort of residential housing area in or around the Santa Barbara area.

If you are a young professional trying to make ends meet I'm sure this looks like an appealing place to live. DO NOT BE FOOLED. The management is bureaucratic and will literally NITPICK at every little thing whether it be something of yours in your own backyard to threatening to tow your car because you haven't put the new tags on it yet ( Between the time I paid for new stickers and got them I was on my ""last notice"" before they said I could expect to find my only means of transportation to support my livelihood at some tow yard on MY dime.

Go figure this though, when I ask for someone to come repair the rotting wood on my backyard fence they made me wait a month and when they FINALLY got around to it it was like pulling teeth...

The manager entered my apartment without permission while I was in my shower. He knocked, waited about 30 seconds (not an over exaggeration) and entered my home and said he needed to do maintenance.

2. They will not give your security deposit back. We have called and sent emails and they were ignoring all of them. So we had to go to them in person. Where they gave us only a small portion of it back so they can’t “paint and clean” We have never thrown a party or had guests over.

3. There is constant work being done. Everyday. They were repainting the roof, and had a sign out that said that they weren’t responsible for paint on cars. But, by the time I went out to see this, my black vehicle was covered in white paint specks to this day. Other people had to cover their vehicles to avoid the paint.

Overall, the apartment is nice. But the management will try their hardest not to give your deposit back, potentially enter your apartment at random moments and there is constant work being done, water shutting off almost every week it seems and loud equipment being used early in the morning constantly.",,,,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM1bnNxcTBBRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x2a2e3dbe7ee04cbe!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIC5nsqq0AE%7CCgsI-oqmqQYQyNKwfQ%7C?hl=en-US,1,1697219962,10/13/2023 17:59:22,0,3039434686903372990,7,0,0,0,6

Sadly, we were not able to see an “actual” apartment but were directed to the website for details about floor plans and pricing but having an actual suite to see while there would’ve been really helpful.  Ana seemed to be friendly and appreciated by the residents we encountered while touring the property which made it seem like she is a “good adult presence” for the students living there.  I would suggest working toward having a list of students’ units available with advanced tour notice so that prospective students can get a better idea of the finishes and furniture inside the suites.  Regarding the students’ privacy, I think there are many ways to provide incentives to the one or two units’ occupants that would make this an option for possible future residents.  The details of the living space are hard to get a feel for from a “floor plan” simulation on the website.",,,,,"Michele,

I think the Cardinal Group has done a terrible job with making sure staff has all the right resources to keep up with its flaws. All the equipment in the gym were rusted over or had cracks/chips in protective coating. Machines did not work due to ocean air exposure and corrosion. The elevator license is more than two years out dated and always broken yet the complex expects the world of their SINGLE handyman who has done all he can to maintain the building by himself to the best of their ability. I feel comfortable giving two stars because the staff has always been nothing but helpful and flexible with all matters at all times. That being said, major renovations are expected especially since rooms are stuffy, dusty, crammed, and small with no circulation or minimal amounts of windows. I’m glad they started with the laundry rooms since they were completely outdated and constantly broken. I hope the management continues to invest in this property since the potential is there. Additionally, having a parking spot should not be an additional $200 monthly add on when rent already ranges from $1,000-$1346.47+ a month.",,,,,"Hello, Sarah  We apologize for the inconvenience you may have experienced at our community.

The Loop is overpriced and management is awful and completely apathetic. I lived there for two years, and in that time we have dealt with multiple floods from floors above, resulting in our walls and ceiling being opened up multiple times and our items getting damaged. The elevator frequently breaks, and people have been stuck unable to open the doors. Theft is common, we have had clothing stolen from the laundry room multiple times, and even items off of our door decorations, and a friend of mine had his speaker stolen. When I reported the thefts, they said there was nothing they could do about the clothing, as there are no cameras in the laundry room, and that they couldn't tell us who stole our door decorations (EVEN THOUGH THEY KNEW WHO IT WAS) because they didn't want to start issues between residents. They forced a new tenant into our room during the pandemic, even though my roommate was high risk (this new tenant made it clear she was unwilling to follow covid protocol, and management upon learning this essentially told us the only thing we could do to prevent them from moving her in was to pay an extra $1420/month in addition to the combined $3000/month we were already paying).
I will say that Luis, who is in charge of maintenance, is awesome. He's friendly, and is quick to take care of maintenance requests. The roof is also great. Just don't move in expecting any kind of respect from management, because they make it abundantly clear that all they want is your money and they do not care about the resident's well-being. We have been lied to by the building's manager multiple times, and they very clearly try to take advantage of college kids who do not know better.
Other things to be aware of, parking spots are limited and go quickly, and cost $200/month, and do not fit longer cars. There is also a $200/month fee for pets. Laundry costs around $1.50 per wash and about the same per drying cycle, but count on at least one washing machine and one dryer being broken, and having to dry your clothes twice as the dryers are not very powerful.",,,,,"Natalie, thank you for your feedback.

However, after speaking with the manager and Luis, it appears that they try to take comments very seriously and are very helpful when it comes to things that concern a resident. As this is my first time renting an apartment, the process seemed seemless and very easy to go through. The only complaint I have is I wished that many of the things in the apartment were fixed the moment you walk in. Also, they don't tell you about a couch that doesn't come with a partially furnished apartment so I am glad that Elizabeth took care of the request to have a couch in the apartment when I asked.

The apartment itself was okay.  The bathroom floor was nasty and in my opinion they did a poor thing cleaning the apartment before we moved in.  There were numerous little things here and there but I figured it's not a new building so told my daughter to deal with them.  The worst experience was toward the end of the lease.  My daughter was in a triple loft with 2 other girls in an open space on the loft.  Both of these 2 girls sub-leased their bed spaces to others for the months of June and July.  One of them turned out to be a BOY.  I was shocked when I found out that The Loop knew and allowed that to happen.  Needless to say I moved my daughter out the day the boy moved in.  So my daughter didn't even lived there for 2 months while I was stuck paying for the rent.  If The Loop management is reading this,  I'd like to request refund for the 2 months that the boy was there.  Also, this boy decided that since my daughter moved out all the spaces belong to him.  So when we turned in the keys early July, the front desk girl couldn't even complete a final walk thru to check us out since there was junks all over my daughter's desk, bed and closet which all belong to the boy.

The roof has a gym with ok dumbells and 2 rusty machines that were probably bought at a yard sale(Lame). The least they could do is put a couple hot tubs up there. They have plenty of space and money for it.

They also have stupid scan cards that occasionally don't work, so I've had to stand outside and wait for a roommate to get me plenty of times. And no one at the front desk ever pickups the phone, so don't even bother calling.

I only have one good thing to say about this place: Louise you are the man!. Everything else is pretty awful. Its overpriced, they lie, they are intrusive.

They advertise double rooms as singles. They use a splintery wooden divider that goes 4 feet up to separate their 'rooms'. I didn't learn about this until I moved in because there are no pictures or even mention of this on their website.

The ""exclusive rooftop gym"" is a few free weights and elliptical. The roof is not exclusive. Tenants aren't allowed to throw parties, however management will rent the roof out to outside parties the majority of weekends. These parties blast loud music throughout the night, often enough to shake the floor of my 3rd floor apartment. Tenants are unable to use the Gym on these days.

The largest issue I have had by far is Privacy here. Every week or so, we will have a 24 hour notice form on our door. Usually tours scheduled for 9AM-10AM. During this time, management will let themselves into your house. They have even opened my roommates bedroom door unannounced, after letting themselves into the apartment at 9AM. These tours  are consistent, and if your apartment is messy they will point it out to you.

Don't let them fool you. They will say ""This is the average price of the area"" or ""Theres nothing else left"". Don't listen. Its not.

They also give gift cards when people write reviews. Probably why their rating has stayed so high over the past year. But its going to catch up eventually.",,,,,"Thank you for the review.

I was in one of the least expensive rooms, (still over $900 a month) but my apartment had a great view. From my side of the building you could see the whole mountain range and it looked right onto the street or ""the loop"" where everyone walks by. It got pretty loud on weekend nights but it was very entertaining to people watch. The management is very responsive and friendly, and the building is very safe since you need a key card to scan in multiple times. The building is modern and fairly updated and the roof is awesome.There are nice laundry rooms on both the 2nd and 3rd floors but they are a bit pricy. There isn't A/C but there isn't anywhere else in isla vista either. Your apartment will come furnished with desks and chairs, twin beds and dressers. The downside of the place is that you will be paying a lot for a small shared space. You can easily find large single rooms in isla vista for less than you would be paying here, however the The Loop is right in the heart of town where all the food and stores are, and you will be a walking distance from all of them which comes in handy.

Also charged me for the pet fee even when I only stayed in that one room divided into 4 ""rooms"" for 2 days and never brought my dog. Worst apartment ever.

For $1750 per month you'd expect in your ""private room"" a wall that makes it private from your roommate's room. No lights in the ""rooms"". To turn on the fan, you need a PIN or PAPERCLIP to press the button. Why? Simply because. Just because. No air-conditioning or ventilation. Which is against the law where I'm from.

Found a place in Santa Barbara for $1200 per month with a much bigger PRIVATE room, great private bathroom, much easier private parking, ALL utilities included and furnished! Keep searching, you'll find a better place that is worth the money! (Try Century Butler Realty in Santa Barbara)

UPDATE: After fighting for a refund, the manager said ""You wouldn't bother going through the trouble of a legal battle to get your money back"" which I proved otherwise. After filing a lawsuit, the owner contacted me and begged that I drop it if he gives me a full refund for the $4,000 + the $1,750 (pet fee included). Do NOT let them bully you.
