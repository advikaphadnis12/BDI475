Sadly, we were not able to see an “actual” apartment but were directed to the website for details about floor plans and pricing but having an actual suite to see while there would’ve been really helpful.  Ana seemed to be friendly and appreciated by the residents we encountered while touring the property which made it seem like she is a “good adult presence” for the students living there.  I would suggest working toward having a list of students’ units available with advanced tour notice so that prospective students can get a better idea of the finishes and furniture inside the suites.  Regarding the students’ privacy, I think there are many ways to provide incentives to the one or two units’ occupants that would make this an option for possible future residents.  The details of the living space are hard to get a feel for from a “floor plan” simulation on the website.",,,,,"Michele,

I think the Cardinal Group has done a terrible job with making sure staff has all the right resources to keep up with its flaws. All the equipment in the gym were rusted over or had cracks/chips in protective coating. Machines did not work due to ocean air exposure and corrosion. The elevator license is more than two years out dated and always broken yet the complex expects the world of their SINGLE handyman who has done all he can to maintain the building by himself to the best of their ability. I feel comfortable giving two stars because the staff has always been nothing but helpful and flexible with all matters at all times. That being said, major renovations are expected especially since rooms are stuffy, dusty, crammed, and small with no circulation or minimal amounts of windows. I’m glad they started with the laundry rooms since they were completely outdated and constantly broken. I hope the management continues to invest in this property since the potential is there. Additionally, having a parking spot should not be an additional $200 monthly add on when rent already ranges from $1,000-$1346.47+ a month.",,,,,"Hello, Sarah  We apologize for the inconvenience you may have experienced at our community.

The Loop is overpriced and management is awful and completely apathetic. I lived there for two years, and in that time we have dealt with multiple floods from floors above, resulting in our walls and ceiling being opened up multiple times and our items getting damaged. The elevator frequently breaks, and people have been stuck unable to open the doors. Theft is common, we have had clothing stolen from the laundry room multiple times, and even items off of our door decorations, and a friend of mine had his speaker stolen. When I reported the thefts, they said there was nothing they could do about the clothing, as there are no cameras in the laundry room, and that they couldn't tell us who stole our door decorations (EVEN THOUGH THEY KNEW WHO IT WAS) because they didn't want to start issues between residents. They forced a new tenant into our room during the pandemic, even though my roommate was high risk (this new tenant made it clear she was unwilling to follow covid protocol, and management upon learning this essentially told us the only thing we could do to prevent them from moving her in was to pay an extra $1420/month in addition to the combined $3000/month we were already paying).
I will say that Luis, who is in charge of maintenance, is awesome. He's friendly, and is quick to take care of maintenance requests. The roof is also great. Just don't move in expecting any kind of respect from management, because they make it abundantly clear that all they want is your money and they do not care about the resident's well-being. We have been lied to by the building's manager multiple times, and they very clearly try to take advantage of college kids who do not know better.
Other things to be aware of, parking spots are limited and go quickly, and cost $200/month, and do not fit longer cars. There is also a $200/month fee for pets. Laundry costs around $1.50 per wash and about the same per drying cycle, but count on at least one washing machine and one dryer being broken, and having to dry your clothes twice as the dryers are not very powerful.",,,,,"Natalie, thank you for your feedback.

However, after speaking with the manager and Luis, it appears that they try to take comments very seriously and are very helpful when it comes to things that concern a resident. As this is my first time renting an apartment, the process seemed seemless and very easy to go through. The only complaint I have is I wished that many of the things in the apartment were fixed the moment you walk in. Also, they don't tell you about a couch that doesn't come with a partially furnished apartment so I am glad that Elizabeth took care of the request to have a couch in the apartment when I asked.

The apartment itself was okay.  The bathroom floor was nasty and in my opinion they did a poor thing cleaning the apartment before we moved in.  There were numerous little things here and there but I figured it's not a new building so told my daughter to deal with them.  The worst experience was toward the end of the lease.  My daughter was in a triple loft with 2 other girls in an open space on the loft.  Both of these 2 girls sub-leased their bed spaces to others for the months of June and July.  One of them turned out to be a BOY.  I was shocked when I found out that The Loop knew and allowed that to happen.  Needless to say I moved my daughter out the day the boy moved in.  So my daughter didn't even lived there for 2 months while I was stuck paying for the rent.  If The Loop management is reading this,  I'd like to request refund for the 2 months that the boy was there.  Also, this boy decided that since my daughter moved out all the spaces belong to him.  So when we turned in the keys early July, the front desk girl couldn't even complete a final walk thru to check us out since there was junks all over my daughter's desk, bed and closet which all belong to the boy.

The roof has a gym with ok dumbells and 2 rusty machines that were probably bought at a yard sale(Lame). The least they could do is put a couple hot tubs up there. They have plenty of space and money for it.

They also have stupid scan cards that occasionally don't work, so I've had to stand outside and wait for a roommate to get me plenty of times. And no one at the front desk ever pickups the phone, so don't even bother calling.

I only have one good thing to say about this place: Louise you are the man!. Everything else is pretty awful. Its overpriced, they lie, they are intrusive.

They advertise double rooms as singles. They use a splintery wooden divider that goes 4 feet up to separate their 'rooms'. I didn't learn about this until I moved in because there are no pictures or even mention of this on their website.

The ""exclusive rooftop gym"" is a few free weights and elliptical. The roof is not exclusive. Tenants aren't allowed to throw parties, however management will rent the roof out to outside parties the majority of weekends. These parties blast loud music throughout the night, often enough to shake the floor of my 3rd floor apartment. Tenants are unable to use the Gym on these days.

The largest issue I have had by far is Privacy here. Every week or so, we will have a 24 hour notice form on our door. Usually tours scheduled for 9AM-10AM. During this time, management will let themselves into your house. They have even opened my roommates bedroom door unannounced, after letting themselves into the apartment at 9AM. These tours  are consistent, and if your apartment is messy they will point it out to you.

Don't let them fool you. They will say ""This is the average price of the area"" or ""Theres nothing else left"". Don't listen. Its not.

They also give gift cards when people write reviews. Probably why their rating has stayed so high over the past year. But its going to catch up eventually.",,,,,"Thank you for the review.

I was in one of the least expensive rooms, (still over $900 a month) but my apartment had a great view. From my side of the building you could see the whole mountain range and it looked right onto the street or ""the loop"" where everyone walks by. It got pretty loud on weekend nights but it was very entertaining to people watch. The management is very responsive and friendly, and the building is very safe since you need a key card to scan in multiple times. The building is modern and fairly updated and the roof is awesome.There are nice laundry rooms on both the 2nd and 3rd floors but they are a bit pricy. There isn't A/C but there isn't anywhere else in isla vista either. Your apartment will come furnished with desks and chairs, twin beds and dressers. The downside of the place is that you will be paying a lot for a small shared space. You can easily find large single rooms in isla vista for less than you would be paying here, however the The Loop is right in the heart of town where all the food and stores are, and you will be a walking distance from all of them which comes in handy.

Also charged me for the pet fee even when I only stayed in that one room divided into 4 ""rooms"" for 2 days and never brought my dog. Worst apartment ever.

For $1750 per month you'd expect in your ""private room"" a wall that makes it private from your roommate's room. No lights in the ""rooms"". To turn on the fan, you need a PIN or PAPERCLIP to press the button. Why? Simply because. Just because. No air-conditioning or ventilation. Which is against the law where I'm from.

Found a place in Santa Barbara for $1200 per month with a much bigger PRIVATE room, great private bathroom, much easier private parking, ALL utilities included and furnished! Keep searching, you'll find a better place that is worth the money! (Try Century Butler Realty in Santa Barbara)

UPDATE: After fighting for a refund, the manager said ""You wouldn't bother going through the trouble of a legal battle to get your money back"" which I proved otherwise. After filing a lawsuit, the owner contacted me and begged that I drop it if he gives me a full refund for the $4,000 + the $1,750 (pet fee included). Do NOT let them bully you.
